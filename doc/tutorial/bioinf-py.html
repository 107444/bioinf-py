Life is definitely digital. The genetic code of all living organisms
are represented by a long sequence of simple molecules called
nucleotides, or bases, which makes up the Deoxyribonucleic acid,
better known as DNA. There are only four such nucleotides, and the
entire genetic code of a human can be seen as a simple, though 3
billion long, string of the letters A, C, G, and T.  Analyzing DNA
data to gain increased biological understanding is much about
searching in (long) strings for certain string patterns involving the
letters A, C, G, and T.  This is an integral part of <em>bioinformatics</em>,
a scientific discipline addressing the use of computers to search
for, explore, and use information about genes, nucleic acids, and
proteins.

<P>
<h2>Basic Bioinformatics Examples in Python <a name="bioinf:basics"></A></h2>
<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>
Below are some very simple examples on DNA analysis that brings together
basic building blocks in programming: loops, <tt>if</tt> tests, and functions.

<P>
<h3>Counting Letters in DNA Strings <a name="bioinf:count"></A></h3>
<P>

<P>
Given some string <tt>dna</tt> containing the letters A, C, G, or T,
representing the bases that make up DNA, we ask the question: how
many times does a certain base occur in the DNA string?
For example, if <tt>dna</tt> is ATGGCATTA and we ask how many times the
base A occur in this string, the answer is 3.

<P>
A general Python implementation answering this problem can be done
in many ways. Several possible solutions are presented below.

<P>
<h4>List Iteration</h4>
<P>

<P>
The most straightforward solution is to loop over the letters
in the string, test if the current letter equals the desired one,
and if so, increase a counter. Looping over the letters is
obvious if the letters are stored in a list. This is easily
done by converting a string to a list:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   ipy-->
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; list('ATGC')
['A', 'T', 'G', 'C']
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Our first solution becomes

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def count_v1(dna, base):
    dna = list(dna)  # convert string to list of letters
    i = 0            # counter
    for c in dna:
        if c == base:
            i += 1
    return i
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
<h4>String Iteration</h4>
<P>

<P>
Python allows us to iterate directly over a string without converting
it to a list:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   ipy-->
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; for c in 'ATGC':
...     print c
A
T
G
C
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
In fact, all built-in objects in Python which contain a set of elements in
a particular sequence allow a <tt>for</tt> loop construction of the
type <tt>for element in object</tt>.
<!-- Examples of such objects are -->
<!-- lists, tuples, strings, arrays, files, dictionaries -->

<P>
A slight improvement of our solution is therefore to iterate directly
over the string:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def count_v2(dna, base):
    i = 0 # counter
    for c in dna:
        if c == base:
            i += 1
    return i

dna = 'ATGCGGACCTAT'
base = 'C'
n = count_v2(dna, base)

# printf-style formatting
print '%s appears %d times in %s' % (base, n, dna)

# or (new) format string syntax
print '{base} appears {n} times in {dna}'.format(
    base=base, n=n, dna=dna)
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
We have illustrated two alternative ways of writing out text
where the value of variables are to be inserted in "slots" in the
string.

<P>
<h4>Program Flow</h4>
<P>
It is fundamental for correct programming to understand how
to simulate a program by hand, statement by
statement. Three tools are
effective for helping you reach the required understanding of performing
a simulation by hand:
(i) printing variables, (ii) using a debugger, and (iii) using an
<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/pgbovine/python/tutor.html">online program flow tool</a>.

<P>
Inserting <tt>print</tt> statements and examining the about is the
simplest approach to investigating
what is going on:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def count_v2_demo(dna, base):
    print 'dna:', dna
    print 'base:', base
    i = 0 # counter
    for c in dna:
        print 'c:', c
        if c == base:
            print 'True if test'
            i += 1
    return i

n = count_v2_demo('ATGCGGACCTAT', 'C')
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>

<P>
<!-- Note: do not use !bc ipy for debugging sessions since -->
<!-- sphinx treats ipy as interactive sessions and therefore -->
<!-- drops any environment (it is automatically handled) -->

<P>
An efficient way to explore this program is to run it in a
debugger where we can step through each statement and see what
is printed out. Start <tt>ipython</tt> in a terminal window and run the
program <tt>count_v2_demo.py</tt> (<a href="http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/doc/tutorial/html/_static/count_v2_demo.py">download</a> or <a href="http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/doc/tutorial/html/_static/count_v2_demo.py.html">online viewing</a>) with
a debugger: <tt>run -d count_v2_demo.py</tt>. Use <tt>s</tt> (for step) to
step through each statement, or <tt>n</tt> (for next) for proceeding to the
next statement without stepping through a function that is called.
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   cod-->
<pre>
ipdb&gt; s
&gt; /some/disk/user/bioinf/src/count_v2_demo.py(2)count_v2_demo()
1     1 def count_v1_demo(dna, base):
----&gt; 2     print 'dna:', dna
      3     print 'base:', base

ipdb&gt; s
dna: ATGCGGACCTAT
&gt; /some/disk/user/bioinf/src/count_v2_demo.py(3)count_v2_demo()
      2     print 'dna:', dna
----&gt; 3     print 'base:', base
      4     i = 0 # counter
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Observe the output of the <tt>print</tt> statements. One can also
print a variable explicitly:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   cod-->
<pre>
ipdb&gt; print base
C
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Misunderstanding of the program flow is one of the most frequent
sources of programming errors, so
whenever in doubt about any program flow, enter a debugger to establish
confidence.

<P>

<P>
The <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/pgbovine/python/tutor.html">Python Online Tutor</a>
is, at least for small programs, a splendid alternative to
debuggers. Go to the webpage, erase the sample code and paste in your
own code. Press <em>Visual execution</em>, then <em>Forward</em> to execute
statements one by one. The status of variables are
explained to the right, and the text field below the program shows the output
from <tt>print</tt> statements.  An example is shown in Figure <a href="#bioinf:fig:pot">bioinf:fig:pot</a>.

</center>

<P>
<h4>Index Iteration</h4>
<P>
Although it is natural in Python to iterate over the letters in a
string (or more generally over elements in a sequence), programmers
with experience from other languages (Fortran, C and Java are
examples) are used to <tt>for</tt> loops with an integer counter running over
a all indices in a string or array:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def count_v3(dna, base):
    i = 0 # counter
    for j in range(len(dna)):
        if dna[j] == base:
            i += 1
    return i
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
Python indices always start at 0 so the legal indices for our
string become <tt>0</tt>, <tt>1</tt>, ...,
<tt>len(dna)-1</tt>, where <tt>len(dna)</tt> is the number of letters in the
string <tt>dna</tt>. The <tt>range(x)</tt> function returns a list of integers
<tt>0</tt>, <tt>1</tt>, ..., <tt>x-1</tt>, implying that <tt>range(len(dna))</tt> generates
all the legal indices for <tt>dna</tt>.

<P>
<h4>While Loops</h4>
<P>
The <tt>while</tt> loop equivalent to the last function reads

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def count_v4(dna, base):
    i = 0 # counter
    j = 0 # string index
    while j &lt; len(dna):
        if dna[j] == base:
            i += 1
        j += 1
    return i
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
Correct indentation is here crucial: a typical error is to fail
indenting the <tt>j += 1</tt> line correctly.

<P>
<h4>Summing a Boolean List</h4>
<P>
The idea now is to create a list <tt>m</tt> where <tt>m[i]</tt> is <tt>True</tt> if
<tt>dna[i]</tt> equals the letter we search for (<tt>base</tt>).
The number of <tt>True</tt> values in <tt>m</tt> is then the number of <tt>base</tt>
letters in <tt>dna</tt>. We can use the <tt>sum</tt> function to find
this number because doing arithmetics with boolean lists
automatically interprets <tt>True</tt> as <tt>1</tt> and <tt>False</tt> as <tt>0</tt>.
That is, <tt>sum(m)</tt> returns the number of <tt>True</tt> elements in <tt>m</tt>.
A possible function doing this is

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def count_v5(dna, base):
    m = []   # matches for base in dna: m[i]=True if dna[i]==base
    for c in dna:
        if c == base:
            m.append(True)
        else:
            m.append(False)
    return sum(m)
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
<h4>Inline If Test</h4>
<P>
Shorter, more compact code is often a goal if the compactness
enhances readability. The four-line <tt>if</tt> test in the previous
function can be condensed to one line using the inline
<tt>if</tt> construction: <tt>if condition value1 else value2</tt>.

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def count_v6(dna, base):
    m = []   # matches for base in dna: m[i]=True if dna[i]==base
    for c in dna:
        m.append(True if c == base else False)
    return sum(m)
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
<h4>Using Boolean Values Directly</h4>
<P>
The inline <tt>if</tt> test is in fact redundant in the previous function
because the value of the condition <tt>c == base</tt> can be used
directly: it has the value <tt>True</tt> or <tt>False</tt>. This saves
some typing and adds clarity, at least to Python programmers:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def count_v7(dna, base):
    m = []   # matches for base in dna: m[i]=True if dna[i]==base
    for c in dna:
        m.append(c == base)
    return sum(m)
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>

<P>
<h4>List Comprehensions</h4>
<P>

<P>
Building a list via a <tt>for</tt> loop can often be condensed to one line
by using list comprehensions: <tt>[expr for e in sequence]</tt>, where
<tt>expr</tt> is some expression normally involving the iteration variable
<tt>e</tt>. In our last example, we can introduce a list comprehension

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def count_v8(dna, base):
    m = [c == base for c in dna]
    return sum(m)
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
Here it is tempting to get rid of the <tt>m</tt> variable and
reduce the function body to a single line:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def count_v9(dna, base):
    return sum([c == base for c in dna])
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
<h4>Using a Sum Iterator</h4>
<P>

<P>
The DNA string is usually huge - 3 billion letters for the human
species. Making a boolean array with <tt>True</tt> and <tt>False</tt> values
therefore increases the memory usage by a factor of two
in our sample functions <tt>count_v5</tt> to <tt>count_v9</tt>.
Summing without actually storing an extra list is desireable.
Fortunately, <tt>sum([x for x in s])</tt> can be replaced
<tt>sum(x for x in s)</tt>, where the latter sums the elements (<tt>x</tt>) in <tt>s</tt>
as <tt>x</tt> visits the elements of <tt>s</tt> one by one. Removing the brackets
therefore avoids first making a list and then applying <tt>sum</tt> on
that list. This is a minor modification of the <tt>count_v9</tt> function:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def count_v10(dna, base):
    return sum(c == base for c in dna)
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
Below we shall measure the impact of the various program constructs
on the CPU time.

<P>
<h4>Extracting Indices</h4>
<P>
Instead of making a boolean list with elements expressing whether
a character matches the given <tt>base</tt> or not, we may collect all
the indices of the matches. This can be done by adding an <tt>if</tt>
test to the list comprehension:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def count_v11(dna, base):
    return len([i for i in range(len(dna)) if dna[i] == base])
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
A debugger or the Python Online Tutorial do not help so much to
understand this compact code. A better approach is to examine
the list comprehension in an interactive Python shell:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   ipy-->
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; dna = 'AATGCTTA'
&gt;&gt;&gt; base = 'A'
&gt;&gt;&gt; indices = [i for i in range(len(dna)) if dna[i] == base]
&gt;&gt;&gt; indices
[0, 1, 7]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print dna[0], dna[1], dna[7]  # check
A A A
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The element <tt>i</tt> in the list comprehension is only made when
<tt>dna[i] == base</tt>.

<P>
<h4>Using Python's Library</h4>
<P>
Very often when you set out to do a task in Python, there is already
functionality for the task in the object itself, in the Python
libraries, or in third-party libraries found on the Internet.
Counting how many times a character (or substring) <tt>base</tt> appears in a
string <tt>dna</tt> is obviously a very common task so Python supports
it by <tt>dna.count(base)</tt>:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def count_v12(dna, base):
    return dna.count(base)
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>

<P>
<h3>Efficiency Assessment <a name="bioinf:count:cpu"></A></h3>
<P>

<P>
Now we have 11 different versions of how to count the occurences
of a letter in a string. Which one of these implementations is the fastest?
To answer the question we need some test data, which should be a
huge string <tt>dna</tt>.

<P>
<h4>Generating Random DNA Strings</h4>
<P>

<P>
The simplest way of generating a long string is to repeat a
character a large number of times:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
N = 1000000
dna = 'A'*N
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The resulting string is just <tt>'AAA...A</tt>, of length <tt>N</tt>, which is fine
for testing the efficiency of Python functions. Nevertheless, it is
more exciting to work with a DNA string with letters from the whole
alphabet A, C, G, and T. To make a DNA string with a random
composition of the characters we can first make a list of random
characters and then join all those characters to a string:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
import random
alphabet = list('ATGC')
dna = [random.choice(alphabet) for i in range(N)]
dna = ''.join(dna)  # join the character elements to a string
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The <tt>random.choice(x)</tt> function selects an element in the list
<tt>x</tt> at random.

<P>
Note that <tt>N</tt> is very often a large number. In Python version 2.x,
<tt>range(N)</tt> generates a list of <tt>N</tt> integers. We can avoid this by
using <tt>xrange</tt> which generates an integer at a time and not the whole
list. In Python version 3.x, the <tt>range</tt> function is actually the
<tt>xrange</tt> function in version 2.x.  Using <tt>xrange</tt>, combining the
statements, and wrapping the construction of a random DNA string in a
function, gives

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
import random

def generate_string(N, alphabet='ATCG'):
    return ''.join([random.choice(alphabet) for i in xrange(N)])

dna = generate_string(600000)
#dna = generate_string(6000000)
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
The call <tt>generate_string(10)</tt> may generate something like <tt>AATGGCAGAA</tt>.

<P>
<h4>Measuring CPU Time</h4>
<P>

<P>
Our next goal is to see how much time the <tt>count_v9</tt> and <tt>count_v10</tt>
functions spend on counting letters in a huge string as generated
above. Measuring the time spent in a program can be done by the <tt>time</tt>
module:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
import time
...
t0 = time.clock()
# do stuff
t1 = time.clock()
cpu_time = t1 - t0
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The <tt>time.clock()</tt> function returns the CPU time spent in the program since
its start. If the interest is in the total time, also including reading
and writing files, <tt>time.time()</tt> is the appropriate function to call.

<P>
Running through all our functions made so far and recording timings can be
done by

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
import time
functions = [count_v1, count_v2, count_v3, count_v4,
             count_v5, count_v6, count_v7, count_v8,
             count_v9, count_v10, count_v11, count_v12]
timings = []  # timings[i] holds CPU time for functions[i]

for function in functions:
    t0 = time.clock()
    function(dna, 'A')
    t1 = time.clock()
    cpu_time = t1 - t0
    timings.append(cpu_time)
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
In Python, functions are ordinary objects so making a list of
functions is no more special than making a list of strings or numbers.

<P>
We can now iterate over <tt>timings</tt> and <tt>functions</tt> simultaneously via <tt>zip</tt>
to make a nice printout of the results:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
for cpu_time, function in zip(timings, functions):
    print '{f:&lt;9s}: {cpu:.2f} s'.format(
        f=function.func_name, cpu=cpu_time)
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
Timings on a MacBook Air 11 running Ubuntu show that
the functions using <tt>list.append</tt> require almost the double of
the time of the functions that work with list comprehensions.
Even faster is the simple iteration over the string.
However, the built-in count functionality of strings
(<tt>dna.count(base)</tt>) runs over 30 times faster than the best of our
handwritten Python functions!
The reason is that the <tt>for</tt> loop needed to count in <tt>dna.count(base)</tt>
is implemented in C and runs very much faster than loops in Python.

<P>
A clear lesson learned is: google around before you start out to implement
what seems to be a quite common task. Others have probably already
done it for you, and most likely is their solution much better than what
you can (easily) come up with.

<P>
All the functions presented above, including the timings,
can be found in the file <tt>count.py</tt> (<a href="http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/doc/tutorial/html/_static/count.py">download</a> or <a href="http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/doc/tutorial/html/_static/count.py.html">online viewing</a>).

<h3>Computing Frequencies <a name="bioinf:freqm"></A></h3>
<P>

<P>

<P>
Your genetic code is essentially the same from you are born until you
die, and the same in your blood and your brain.  Which genes that are
turned on and off make the difference between the cells. This
regulation of genes is orchestrated by an immensely complex mechanism,
which we have only started to understand. A central part of this
mechanism consists of molecules called transcription factors that
float around in the cell and attach to DNA, and in doing so turn
nearby genes on or off. These molecules bind preferentially to
specific DNA sequences, and this binding preference pattern can be
represented by a table of frequencies of given symbols at each
position of the pattern.  More precisely, each row in the table
corresponds to the bases A, C, G, and T, while column j reflects how
many times the base appears in position j in the DNA sequence.

<P>
For example, if our set of DNA sequences are
TAG, GGT, and GGG, the table becomes

<P>
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="center"><b>base</b></td> <td align="center"><b> 0  </b></td> <td align="center"><b> 1  </b></td> <td align="center"><b> 2  </b></td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   A       </td> <td align="center">   0       </td> <td align="center">   1       </td> <td align="center">   0       </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   C       </td> <td align="center">   0       </td> <td align="center">   0       </td> <td align="center">   0       </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   G       </td> <td align="center">   2       </td> <td align="center">   2       </td> <td align="center">   2       </td> </tr>
<tr><td align="left">   T       </td> <td align="center">   1       </td> <td align="center">   0       </td> <td align="center">   1       </td> </tr>
</table>
<P>
From this table we can read that base A appears once in index 1 in the
DNA strings, base C does not appear at all, base G appears twice in
all positions, and base T appears once in the beginning and end of the
strings.

<P>
In the following we shall present different data structures to
hold such a table and different ways of computing them.
The table is known as a <em>frequency matrix</em> in bioinformatics,
and this is the term used here too.

<P>

<P>
<h4>Separate Frequency Lists</h4>
<P>
Since we know that there are only four rows in the frequency matrix,
an obvious data structure would be four lists, each holding
a row. A function computing these lists may look like

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def freq_lists(dna_list):
    n = len(dna_list[0])
    A = [0]*n
    T = [0]*n
    G = [0]*n
    C = [0]*n
    for dna in dna_list:
        for index, base in enumerate(dna):
            if base == 'A':
                A[index] += 1
            elif base == 'C':
                C[index] += 1
            elif base == 'G':
                G[index] += 1
            elif base == 'T':

<P>
We need to initialize the lists with the right length and a zero
for each element, since each list element is to be used as a counter.
Creating a list of length <tt>n</tt> with object <tt>x</tt> in all positions
is done by <tt>[x]*n</tt>. Finding the proper length is here carried out by
inspecting the length of the first element in <tt>dna_list</tt>, assuming
that all elements have the same length.

<P>
In the <tt>for</tt> loop we apply the <tt>enumerate</tt> function which is used
to extract both the element value <em>and</em> the element index when
iterating over a sequence. For example,
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   ipy-->
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; for index, base in enumerate(['t', 'e', 's', 't']):
...   print index, base
...
0 t
1 e
2 s
3 t
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
Here is a call and printout of the results:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
dna_list = ['GGTAG', 'GGTAC', 'GGTGC']
A, C, G, T = freq_lists(dna_list)
print A
print C
print G
print T
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
with output
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   dat-->
<pre>
[0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
[3, 3, 0, 1, 1]
[0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
</pre>

<P>
<h4>Nested List</h4>
<P>
The frequency matrix can also be represented as a nested list <tt>M</tt>
such that <tt>M[i][j]</tt> is the frequency of base <tt>i</tt> in position <tt>j</tt>
in the set of DNA strings. Here <tt>i</tt> is an integer, where 0 corresponds to A,
1 to T, 2 to G, and 3 to C. The frequency is the number of times
base <tt>i</tt> appears in position <tt>j</tt> in a set of DNA strings.
Sometimes this number is divided by the number of DNA strings in
the set so that the frequency is between 0 and 1. Note all
the DNA strings must have the same length.

<P>
The simplest way to make a nested list is to insert the
<tt>A</tt>, <tt>C</tt>, <tt>G</tt>, and <tt>T</tt> lists into another list:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; frequency_matrix = [A, C, G, T]
&gt;&gt;&gt; frequency_matrix[2][3]
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; G[3]  # same element
2
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
Nevertheless, we can illustrate how to compute this type of nested
list directly:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def freq_list_of_lists_v1(dna_list):
    # Create empty frequency_matrix[i][j] = 0
    # i=0,1,2,3 corresponds to A,T,G,C
    # j=0,...,length of dna_list[0]
    frequency_matrix = [[0 for v in dna_list[0]] for x in 'ACGT']

    for dna in dna_list:
      for index, base in enumerate(dna):
          if base == 'A':
              frequency_matrix[0][index] +=1
          elif base == 'C':
              frequency_matrix[1][index] +=1
          elif base == 'G':
              frequency_matrix[2][index] +=1
          elif base == 'T':
              frequency_matrix[3][index] +=1

    return frequency_matrix
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
As in the case with individual lists we need to initialize all elements
in the nested list to zero.

<P>
A call and printout,
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
dna_list = ['GGTAG', 'GGTAC', 'GGTGC']
frequency_matrix = freq_list_of_lists_v1(dna_list)
print frequency_matrix
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
results in
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   dat-->
<pre>
[[0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [3, 3, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]]

<h4>Dictionary for More Convenient Indexing</h4>
<P>

<P>
The <tt>if</tt> tests in the <tt>freq_list_of_lists_v1</tt> are somewhat cumbersone,
especially if want to extend the code to other bioinformatics problems
where the alphabet is larger. What we want is a mapping from <tt>base</tt>,
which is a character, to the corresponding index 0, 1, 2, or 3.
A Python dictionary represents such mappings:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   ipy-->
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; base2index = {'A': 0, 'C': 1, 'G': 2, 'T': 3}
&gt;&gt;&gt; base2index['G']
2
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
With the <tt>base2index</tt> dictionary we do not need the series of
<tt>if</tt> tests and the alphabet <tt>'ATGC'</tt> could be much larger
without affecting the length of the code.

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def freq_list_of_lists_v2(dna_list):
    frequency_matrix = [[0 for v in dna_list[0]] for x in 'ACGT']
    base2index = {'A': 0, 'C': 1, 'G': 2, 'T': 3}
    for dna in dna_list:
        for index, base in enumerate(dna):
            frequency_matrix[base2index[base]][index] += 1

    return frequency_matrix
</pre>

<P>
<h4>Numerical Python Array</h4>
<P>
As long as each sublist in a list of lists has the same length, a
list of lists can be replaced by a Numerical Python (<tt>numpy</tt>) array.
Processing of such arrays is often much more efficient than
processing of the nested list data structure.
To initialize a two-dimensional <tt>numpy</tt> array we need to know its
size, here 4 times <tt>len(dna_list[0])</tt>. Only the first line in the function
<tt>freq_list_of_lists_v2</tt> needs to be changed in order to utilize
a <tt>numpy</tt> array:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
import numpy as np

def freq_numpy(dna_list):
    frequency_matrix = np.zeros((4, len(dna_list[0])), dtype=np.int)
    base2index = {'A': 0, 'C': 1, 'G': 2, 'T': 3}
    for dna in dna_list:
        for index, base in enumerate(dna):
            frequency_matrix[base2index[base]][index] += 1

    return frequency_matrix
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
The resulting <tt>frequency_matrix</tt> object can be indexed as
<tt>[b][i]</tt> or <tt>[b,i]</tt>, with integers <tt>b</tt> and <tt>i</tt>. A typical
indexing is <tt>frequency_matrix[base2index['C'],i]</tt>.

<P>
<h4>Dictionary of Lists</h4>
<P>
Instead of going from a character to an integer index via
<tt>base2index</tt>, we may prefer to index <tt>frequency_matrix</tt> by the base name
and the position index directly: like in`['C'][14]`.
This is the most natural syntax for a user of the
frequency matrix.  The relevant Python data structure is then a
dictionary of lists. That is, <tt>frequency_matrix</tt> is a dictionary with
keys <tt>'A'</tt>, <tt>'C'</tt>, <tt>'G'</tt>, and <tt>'T'</tt>. The value for each key is a
list. Let us now also extend the flexibility such that <tt>dna_list</tt> can
have DNA strings of different lengths. The lists in <tt>frequency_list</tt>
will have lengths equal to the longest DNA string.  A relevant
function is

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def freq_dict_of_lists_v1(dna_list):
    n = max([len(dna) for dna in dna_list])
    frequency_matrix = {
        'A': [0]*n,
        'C': [0]*n,
        'G': [0]*n,
        'T': [0]*n,
        }
    for dna in dna_list:

results in the output
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   dat-->

 'T': [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
The initialization of <tt>frequency_matrix</tt> in the above code can
be made more compact by using a dictionary comprehension:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
dict = {key: value for key in some_sequence}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Here,
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
frequency_matrix = {base: [0]*n for base in 'ACGT'}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Adopting this construction in the <tt>freq_dict_of_lists_v1</tt> function
leads to a slightly more compact version,

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def freq_dict_of_lists_v2(dna_list):
    n = max([len(dna) for dna in dna_list])
    frequency_matrix = {base: [0]*n for base in 'ACGT'}
    for dna in dna_list:
        for index, base in enumerate(dna):
            frequency_matrix[base][index] += 1

    return frequency_matrix
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>

<P>
<h4>Dictionary of Dictionaries</h4>
<P>
The dictionary of lists data structure can alternatively be replaced
by a dictionary of dictionaries object, often just called a dict of
dicts object. That is, <tt>frequency_matrix[base]</tt> is a dictionary with
key <tt>i</tt> and value equal to the added number of occurences of <tt>base</tt> in
<tt>dna[i]</tt> for all <tt>dna</tt> strings in the list <tt>dna_list</tt>.  The indexing
<tt>frequency_matrix['C'][i]</tt> and the values are exactly as in the last
example; the only difference is whether <tt>frequency_matrix['C']</tt> is a
list or dictionary.

<P>
Our function working with <tt>frequency_matrix</tt> as a dict of dicts
is written

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def freq_dict_of_dicts_v1(dna_list):
    n = max([len(dna) for dna in dna_list])
    frequency_matrix = {base: {index: 0 for index in range(n)}
                        for base in 'ACGT'}
    for dna in dna_list:
        for index, base in enumerate(dna):
            frequency_matrix[base][index] += 1

    return frequency_matrix

<h4>Using Dictionaries with Default Values</h4>
<P>
The manual initialization of each subdictionary to zero,
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
    frequency_matrix = {base: {index: 0 for index in range(n)}
                        for base in 'ACGT'}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
can be simplified by using a dictionary with default values for any
key. The construction <tt>defaultdict(lambda: obj)</tt>
makes a dictionary with <tt>obj</tt> as default value.
This construction simplifies the previous function a bit:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
from collections import defaultdict

def freq_dict_of_dicts_v2(dna_list):
    n = max([len(dna) for dna in dna_list])
    frequency_matrix = {base: defaultdict(lambda: 0)
                        for base in 'ACGT'}
    for dna in dna_list:
        for index, base in enumerate(dna):
            frequency_matrix[base][index] += 1

    return frequency_matrix
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
<b>Remark.</b> Dictionary comprehensions were new in Python 2.7 and 3.1, but can be
simulated in earlier versions by making (key, value) tuples via
list comprehensions. A dictionary comprehension
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
d = {key: value for key in sequence}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
is then constructed as
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
d = dict([(key, value) for key in sequence])
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
<h4>Using Arrays and Vectorization</h4>
<P>
The dict of lists data structure for <tt>frequency_matrix</tt> can easily be
changed to a dict of <tt>numpy</tt> arrays: just replace the initialization
<tt>[0]*n</tt> by <tt>np.zeros(n, dtype=np.int)</tt>. The indexing remains the same:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def freq_dict_of_arrays_v1(dna_list):
    n = max([len(dna) for dna in dna_list])
    frequency_matrix = {base: np.zeros(n, dtype=np.int)
                        for base in 'ACGT'}
    for dna in dna_list:
        for index, base in enumerate(dna):
            frequency_matrix[base][index] += 1

    return frequency_matrix
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
Having <tt>frequency_matrix[base]</tt> as a <tt>numpy</tt> array instead of a list
does not give any immediate advantage, as the storage and CPU time is
about the same. The loop over the <tt>dna</tt> string and the associated
indexing is what consumes all the CPU time.  However, the <tt>numpy</tt>
arrays provides a potential for increasing efficiency through
vectorization, i.e., replacing the element-wise operations on <tt>dna</tt>
and <tt>frequency_matrix[base]</tt> by operations on the whole arrays at
once.

<P>
Let us use the interactive Python shell to
explore the possibilities of vectorization.
We first convert the string to a <tt>numpy</tt> array of characters:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; dna = 'ACAT'
&gt;&gt;&gt; dna = np.array(dna, dtype='c')
&gt;&gt;&gt; dna
array(['A', 'C', 'A', 'T'],
      dtype='|S1')
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
For a given base, say A, we can in one vectorized operation find
which locations in <tt>dna</tt> that contain <tt>A</tt>:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   cod-->
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = dna == 'A'
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
array([ True, False,  True, False], dtype=bool)
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
By converting <tt>b</tt> to an integer array <tt>i</tt> we can
update the frequency counts
for all indices by adding <tt>i</tt> to <tt>frequency_matrix['A']</tt>:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   cod-->
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; i = np.asarray(b, dtype=np.int)
&gt;&gt;&gt; i
array([1, 0, 1, 0])
&gt;&gt;&gt; frequency_matrix['A'] = frequency_matrix['A'] + i
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
This recipe can be repeated for all bases:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
    for dna in dna_list:
        dna = np.array(dna, dtype='c')
        for base in 'ACGT':
            b = dna == base
            i = np.asarray(b, dtype=np.int)
            frequency_matrix[base] = frequency_matrix[base] + i
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
It turns out that we do not need to convert the boolean array <tt>b</tt>
to an integer array <tt>i</tt>, because doing arithmetics with <tt>b</tt> directly
is possible: <tt>False</tt> is interpreted as 0 and <tt>True</tt> as 1 in arithmetic
operations.  We can also use
the <tt>+=</tt> operator to update all elements of <tt>frequency_matrix[base]</tt>
directly, without first computing the sum of two arrays
<tt>frequency_matrix[base] + i</tt> and then assigning this result to
<tt>frequency_matrix[base]</tt>.
Collecting all these ideas in one function yields the code

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def freq_dict_of_arrays_v2(dna_list):
    n = max([len(dna) for dna in dna_list])
    frequency_matrix = {base: np.zeros(n, dtype=np.int)
                        for base in 'ACGT'}
    for dna in dna_list:
        dna = np.array(dna, dtype='c')
        for base in 'ACCT':
            frequency_matrix[base] += dna == base

    return frequency_matrix
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
This vectorized function runs almost 10 times as fast as the
(scalar) counterpart <tt>freq_list_of_arrays_v1</tt>!

<h3>Analyzing the Frequency Matrix <a name="bioinf:freq:analysis"></A></h3>
<P>

<P>
Having built a frequency matrix out of a collection of DNA strings, it
is time to use it for analysis.
The short DNA strings that a frequency matrix is built out of, is
typically a set of substrings of a larger DNA sequence, which shares
some common purpose. An example of this is to have a set of substrings
that serves as a kind of anchors/magnets at which given molecules
attach to DNA and perform biological functions (like turning genes on
or off). With the frequency matrix constructed from a limited set of
known anchor locations (substrings), we can now scan for other similar
substrings that have the potential to perform the same function. The
simplest way to do this is to first determine the most typical
substring according to the frequency matrix, i.e., the substring having
the most frequent nucleotide at each position. This is referred to as
the consensus string of the frequency matrix. We can then look for
occurrences of the consensus substring in a larger DNA sequence, and
consider these occurrences as likely candidates for serving the same
function (e.g., as anchor locations for molecules).

<P>
For instance,
given three substrings ACT, CCA and AGA, the frequency matrix
would be (list of lists, with rows corresponding to A, C, G, and T):
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   dat-->
<pre>
[[2, 0, 2]
 [1, 2, 0]
 [0, 1, 0]
 [0, 0, 1]]
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
We see that for position 0,
which corresponds to the left-most columnin the table, the symbol A has the
highest frequency (2). The maximum frequencies for the other positions
are seen to be C for position 1, and A for position 2. The consensus
string is therefore ACA.  Note that the consensus string does not need to be
equal to any of the substrings that formed the basis of the frequency
matrix (this is indeed the case for the above example).

<P>

<P>

<P>
<h4>List of Lists Frequency Matrix</h4>
<P>
Let <tt>frequency_matrix</tt> be a list of lists. For each position <tt>i</tt> we
run through the "rows" in the frequency matrix and keep track of the
maximum frequency value and the corresponding letter. If two or
more letters have the same frequency value we use a dash to
indicate that this position in the consensus string is undetermined.

<P>
The following function computes the consensus string:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def find_consensus_v1(frequency_matrix):
    base2index = {'A': 0, 'C': 1, 'G': 2, 'T': 3}
    consensus = ''
    dna_length = len(frequency_matrix[0])

    for i in range(dna_length):  # loop over positions in string
        max_freq = -1            # holds the max freq. for this i
        max_freq_base = None     # holds the corresponding base

        for base in 'ATGC':
            if frequency_matrix[base2index[base]][i] &gt; max_freq:
                max_freq = frequency_matrix[base2index[base]][i]
                max_freq_base = base
            elif frequency_matrix[base2index[base]][i] == max_freq:
                max_freq_base = '-' # more than one base as max

        consensus += max_freq_base  # add new base with max freq
    return consensus
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
Since this code requires <tt>frequency_matrix</tt> to be a list of lists
we should insert a test and raise an exception if the
type is wrong:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def find_consensus_v1(frequency_matrix):
    if isinstance(frequency_matrix, list) and \ 
       isinstance(frequency_matrix[0], list):

    else:
        raise TypeError('frequency_matrix must be list of lists')
...
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
<h4>Dict of Dicts Frequency Matrix</h4>
<P>
How must the <tt>find_consensus_v1</tt> function be altered if <tt>frequency_matrix</tt>
is a dict of dicts?

<P>

<ol>
 <li> The <tt>base2index</tt> dict is no longer needed.
 <li> Access of sublist, <tt>frequency_matrix[0]</tt>, to test for type and

</ol>

The updated function becomes

Let us try <tt>find_consensus_v3</tt> with the dict of defaultdicts
as input (<tt>freq_dicts_of_dicts_v2</tt>). The code runs fine, but
the output string is just <tt>G</tt>!
The reason is that <tt>dna_length</tt> is 1, and therefore that the length of
the <tt>A</tt> dict in <tt>frequency_matrix</tt> is 1.
Printing out <tt>frequency_matrix</tt> yields
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
{'A': defaultdict(X, {3: 2}),
 'C': defaultdict(X, {4: 2}),
 'G': defaultdict(X, {0: 3, 1: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1}),
 'T': defaultdict(X, {2: 3})}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
where our <tt>X</tt> is a short form for text like
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
`&lt;function &lt;lambda&gt; at 0xfaede8&gt;`
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
We see that the length of a defaultdict will only count the nonzero
entries. Hence, to use a defaultdict our function must get the length of the DNA string to
build as an extra argument:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->

def find_consensus_v4(frequency_matrix, dna_length):
    ...
</pre>

<P>
Exercise <a href="#bioinf:exer:freq:fargs">bioinf:exer:freq:fargs</a> suggest to make a unified
<tt>find_consensus</tt> function which works with all of the different
representation of <tt>frequency_matrix</tt> that we have used.

<h3>Dot Plots from Pair of DNA Sequences <a name="bioinf:dotplot"></A></h3>
<P>

<P>
[<b>hpl</b>: <em>I don't get what dot plots are good for. Even when comparing two
identical strings the dots don't show a strong correlation (because
there are just 4 letters to choose among the chances of having
the same letter in pos i and j of the two strings is significant.
There should be something visual here.</em>]

<P>
Dot plots are commonly used to visualize the similarity between two protein or
nucleic acid sequences. They compare two sequences, say <tt>d1</tt> and <tt>d2</tt>,
by organizing <tt>d1</tt>
along the x-axis and <tt>d2</tt> along the y-axis of a plot.
When <tt>d1[i] == d2[j]</tt> we mark this by drawing a dot at location
<tt>i,j</tt> in the plot. An example is
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   dat-->
<pre>
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The origin is in the upper left corner, which means that the
first string has its indices running to the right 0, 1, 2, and so forth,
while the second string has its indices running down, row by row.

<P>
In the forthcoming examples, a dot is represented by 1. No presence at
a given location is represented by 0. A dot plot can be manually read
to find common patterns between two sequences that has undergone
several insertions and deletions, and it serves as a conceptual basis
for algorithms that align two sequences in order to find evolutionary
origin or shared functional parts. Such alignment of biological
sequences is a particular variant of finding the edit distance between
strings, which is a general technique, also used for, e.g., spell
correction in search engines.

<P>
The dot plot data structure must mimic a table.  The "x" direction is
along rows, while the "y" direction is along columns. First we need to
initialize the whole data structure with zeros. Then, for each for
each position in the "x string" we run through all positions in the "y
string" and mark those where the characters match with 1.
The algorithm will be clear when presented with specific Python code.

<P>
<h4>Using Lists of Lists</h4>
<P>
Since the plot is essentially a table, a list of lists is therefore
a natural data structure. The following function creates the
list of lists:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def dotplot_list_of_lists(dna_x, dna_y):
    dotplot_matrix = [['0' for x in dna_x] for y in dna_y]
    for x_index, x_value in enumerate(dna_x):
        for y_index, y_value in enumerate(dna_y):
            if x_value == y_value:
                dotplot_matrix[y_index][x_index] = '1'
    return dotplot_matrix
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
To view the dot plot we need to print out the list of lists. Here
is a possible way:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
dna_x = 'TAATGCCTGAAT'
dna_y = 'CTCTATGCC'

M = dotplot_list_of_lists(dna_x, dna_x)
for row in M:
    for column in row:
        print column,
    print
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
The output becomes
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   dat-->
<pre>
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
One can, alternatively, translate the list of lists to a multi-line string
containing the whole plot as a string object.
This implies joining all the characters in each row and then joining
all the rows:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
rows = [' '.join(row) for row in dotplot_matrix]
plot = '\n'.join(rows)
# or combined
plot = '\n'.join([' '.join(row) for row in dotplot_matrix])
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The construction <tt>'d'.join(l)</tt> joints
all the string elements of the
list <tt>l</tt> and inserts <tt>d</tt> as delimiter: <tt>'x'.join(['A','B','C'])</tt>
becomes <tt>'AxBxC'</tt>.
We use a space as delimiter among the characters in a row since this
gives a nice layout when printing the string. All rows are joined with
newline as delimiter such that the rows appear on separate lines when
printing the string.  To really understand what is going on, a more
comprehensive code could be made so that each step can be examined:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def make_string_expanded(dotplot_matrix):
    rows = []
    for row in dotplot_matrix:
        row_string = ' '.join(row)
        rows.append(row_string)
    plot = '\n'.join(rows)
    return plot

M2 = [['1', '1', '0', '1'],
     ['1', '1', '1', '1'],
     ['0', '0', '1', '0'],
     ['0', '0', '0', '1']]

s = make_string_expanded(M2)
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
Unless the join operation as used here is well understood, it is highly
recommended to paste the above code into the <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/pgbovine/python/tutor.html">Python Online Tutor</a>, step
through the code, and watch how variables change their content.

<h4>Using Numerical Python Arrays</h4>

<h3>Finding Base Frequencies <a name="bioinf:basefreq"></A></h3>
<P>

<P>
DNA consists of four molecules called nucleotides, or bases, and can
be represented as a string of the letters A, C, G, and T. But this
does not mean that all four nucleotides need to be similarly
frequent. Are some nucleotides more frequent than others, say in
yeast, as represented by the first chromosome of yeast? Also, DNA is
really not a single thread, but two threads wound together.  This
wounding is based on an A from one thread binding to a T of the other
thread, and C binding to G (that is, A will only bind with T, not with
C or G).  Could this fact force groups of the four symbol frequencies
to be equal?  The answer is that the A-T and G-C binding does not in principle
force certain frequencies to be equal, but in practice they usually
become so because of evolutionary factors related to this pairing.

<P>
The first task is to compute the frequencies of the bases
A, C, G, and T. That is, the number of times each base occurs
in the DNA string, divided by the length of the string.
For example, if the DNA string is ACGGAAA, the length is 7, A appears
4 times with frequency 4/7, C appears once with frequency 1/7,
G appears twice with frequency 2/7, and T does not appear so the
frequency is 0.

<P>
From a coding perspective we may create a function for counting how
many times A, C, G, and T appears in the string and then another
function for computing the frequencies. In both cases we want
dictionaries such that we can index with the character and get the
count or the frequency out.
Counting is done by

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def get_base_counts(dna):
    counts = {'A': 0, 'T': 0, 'G': 0, 'C': 0}
    for base in dna:
        counts[base] += 1
    return counts
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
This function can then be used to compute the base frequencies:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def get_base_frequencies_v1(dna):
    counts = get_base_counts(dna)
    return {base: count*1.0/len(dna)
            for base, count in counts.items()}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Since we learned at the end of the section <a href="#bioinf:count:cpu">Efficiency Assessment</a> that
<tt>dna.count(base)</tt> was much faster than the various manual
implementations of counting, we can write a faster and simpler
function for computing all the base frequencies:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def get_base_frequencies_v2(dna):
        return {base: dna.count(base)/float(len(dna))
                for base in 'ATGC'}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
A little test,

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
dna = 'ACCAGAGT'
frequencies = get_base_frequencies_v2(dna)

def format_frequencies(frequencies):
    return ', '.join(['%s: %.2f' % (base, frequencies[base])
                      for base in frequencies])

print "Base frequencies of sequence '%s':\n%s" % \ 
      (dna, format_frequencies(frequencies))
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
gives the result
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   dat-->
<pre>
Base frequencies of sequence 'ACCAGAGT':
A: 0.38, C: 0.25, T: 0.12, G: 0.25
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The <tt>format_frequencies</tt> function was made for nice printout of
the frequencies with 2 decimals. The one-line code is an effective
combination of a dictionary, list comprehension, and the
<tt>join</tt> functionality. The latter is used to get a comma correctly
inserted between the items in the result. Lazy programmers would
probably just do a <tt>print frequencies</tt> and live with the
curly braces in the output and (in general) 16 disturbing decimals.

<P>

<P>
We can try the frequency computation on real data. The file
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block  -->
<pre>
http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/doc/src/data/yeast_chr1.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
contains the DNA for yeast. We can download this file from
the Internet by
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=name_of_local_file)
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
where <tt>url</tt> is the Internet address of the file and <tt>name_of_local_file</tt>
is a string containing the name of the file on the computer where the
file is downloaded.
To avoid repeated downloads when the program is run multiple times,
we insert a test on whether the local file exists or not. The
call <tt>os.path.isfile(f)</tt> returns <tt>True</tt> if a file with name <tt>f</tt> exists
in the current working folder.

<P>
The appropriate download code then becomes

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
import urllib, os
urlbase = 'http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/doc/src/data/'
yeast_file = 'yeast_chr1.txt'
if not os.path.isfile(yeast_file):
    url = urlbase + yeast_file
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=yeast_file)
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
A copy of the file on the Internet is now in the current working folder
under the name <tt>yeast_chr1.txt</tt>.

<P>

<P>
The <tt>yeast_chr1.txt</tt> files contains the DNA string split over many lines.
We therefore need to read the lines in this file, strip each line to
remove the trailing newline, and join all the stripped lines to
recover the DNA string:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def read_dnafile_v1(filename):
    lines = open(filename, 'r').readlines()
    # Remove newlines in each line (line.strip()) and join
    dna = ''.join([line.strip() for line in lines])
    return dna
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
As usual, an alternative programming solution can be devised:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def read_dnafile_v2(filename):
    dna = ''
    for line in open(filename, 'r'):
        dna += line.strip()
    return dna

dna = read_dnafile_v2(yeast_file)
yeast_freq = get_base_frequencies_v2(dna)
print "Base frequencies of yeast DNA (length %d):\n%s" % \ 
      (len(dna), format_frequencies(yeast_freq))
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
The output becomes
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   dat-->
<pre>
Base frequencies of yeast DNA (length 230208):
A: 0.30, C: 0.19, T: 0.30, G: 0.20
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
The varying frequency of different nucleotides in DNA is referred to
as nucleotide bias. The nucleotide bias varies between organisms, and
have a range of biological implications. For many organisms the
nucleotide bias has been highly optimized through evolution and
reflects characteristics of the organisms and their environments, for
instance the typical temperature the organism is adapted to.

<h3>Translating Genes into Proteins <a name="bioinf:gene2protein"></A></h3>
<P>

<P>
An important usage of DNA is for cells to store information on their
arsenal of proteins. Briefly, a gene is, in essence, a region of the
DNA, consisting of several coding parts (called exons), interspersed
by non-coding parts (called introns).  The coding parts are
concatenated to form a string called mRNA, where also occurrences of
the letter T in the coding parts are substituted by a U. A triplet of
mRNA letters code for a specific amino acid, which are the building
blocks of proteins. Consecutive triplets of letters in mRNA in this
way define a specific sequence of amino acids, which amounts to a
certain protein.  Here is an example of using the mapping from DNA to
proteins to create the Lactase protein (LPH), using the DNA sequence
of the Lactase gene (LCT) as underlying code. An important functional
property of LPH is in diguesting Lactose which is found most notably
in milk. Lack of the functionality of LPH leads to digestive problems
referred to as lactose intolerance. Most mammals and humans lose their
expression of LCT and therefore their ability to digest milk when they
stop recieving breast milk.

The first column is the genetic code (triplet in mRNA),
while the other columns represent
various ways of expressing the corresponding amino acid:
a 1-letter symbol, a 3-letter name, and the full name.

<P>
Downloading the <tt>genetic_code.tsv</tt> file can be done by
this robust function:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def download(urlbase, filename):

        except IOError, e:
            raise IOError('No Internet connection')
        # Check if downloaded file is an HTML file, which
        # is what github.com returns if the URL is not existing
        f = open(filename, 'r')
        if 'DOCTYPE html' in f.readline():
            raise IOError('URL %s does not exist' % url)

</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
We want to make a dictionary of the <tt>genetic_code.tsv</tt> file that maps
the code in the first column onto the 1-letter symbol in the second
column.  Downloading the file, reading it and making the dictionary
are done by

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
urlbase = 'http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/data/'
genetic_code_file = 'genetic_code.tsv'
download(urlbase, genetic_code_file)
code = read_genetic_code_v1(genetic_code_file)
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
Not surprisingly, the <tt>read_genetic_code_v1</tt> can be made much shorter
by collecting the first two columns as list of 2-lists and then
converting the 2-lists to key-value pairs in a dictionary:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def read_genetic_code_v2(filename):
    return dict([line.split()[0:2] for line in open(filename, 'r')])
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
Creating a mapping of the code onto all the three variants of the amino
acid name is
also of interest. For example, we would like to make look ups like
<tt>['CUU']['3-letter']</tt> or <tt>['CUU']['amino acid']</tt>. This requires
a dictionary of dictionaries:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def read_genetic_code_v3(filename):
    genetic_code = {}
    for line in open(filename, 'r'):
        columns = line.split()
        genetic_code[columns[0]] = {}
        genetic_code[columns[0]]['1-letter']   = columns[1]
        genetic_code[columns[0]]['3-letter']   = columns[2]
        genetic_code[columns[0]]['amino acid'] = columns[3]
    return genetic_code
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
An alternative way of writing the last function is

To form mRNA, we need to grab the exon regions (the coding parts) of
the lactase gene.  These regions are substrings of the lactase gene
DNA string, corresponding to the start and end positions of the exon
regions.  Then we must replace T by U, and combine all the substrings
to build the mRNA string.

<P>
Two straightforward subtasks are to load the lactase gene and its exon
positions into variables.  The file <tt>lactase_gene.txt</tt>, at the same
Internet location as the other files, stores the lactase gene. The file
has the same format as <tt>yeast_chr1.txt</tt>. Using the <tt>download</tt> function
and the previously shown <tt>read_dnafile_v1</tt>, we can easily load the
data in the file into the string <tt>lactase_gene</tt>.

<P>
The exon regions are described in a file <tt>lactase_exon.tsv</tt>, also
found at the same Internet site as the other files. The file is easily
downloaded by calling <tt>download</tt>.  The file format is very simple in
that each line holds the start and end positions of an exon region:

We want to have this information available in a list of (start,end)

For simplicity's sake, we shall consider mRNA as the concatenation of exons,
although in reality, additional base pairs are added to each end.
Having the lactase gene as a string and the exon regions as a list of
(start,end) tuples, it is straightforward to extract the regions
as substrings, replace T by U, and add all the substrings together:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->

    mrna = ''

        mrna += gene[start:end].replace('T','U')
    return mrna

mrna = create_mRNA(lactase_gene, lactase_exon_regions)
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
We would like to store the mRNA string in a file, using the same
format as <tt>lactase_gene.txt</tt> and <tt>yeast_chr1.txt</tt>, i.e.,
the string is split on multiple lines with, e.g., 70 characters per line.
An appropriate function doing this is

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->

def tofile_with_line_sep_v1(text, filename, chars_per_line=70):
    outfile = open(filename, 'w')
    for i in xrange(0, len(text), chars_per_line):
        start = i
        end = start + chars_per_line

It might be convenient to have a separate folder for files that we create.
Python has good support for testing if a folder exists, and if not,
make a folder:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
output_folder = 'output'
if not os.path.isdir(output_folder):
    os.mkdir(output_folder)
filename = os.path.join(output_folder, 'lactase_mrna.txt')
tofile_with_line_sep_v1(mrna, filename)
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Python's term for folder is directory, which explains why <tt>isdir</tt> is
the function name for testing on a folder existence. Observe
especially that the combination of a folder and a filename is done via
<tt>os.path.join</tt> rather than just inserting a forward slash, or backward
slash on Windows: <tt>os.path.join</tt> will insert the right slsah, forward
or backward, depending on the current operating system.

<P>
Occasionally, the output folder is nested, say
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
output_folder = os.path.join('output', 'lactase')
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
In that case <tt>os.mkdir(output_folder)</tt> may fail because
the intermediate folder <tt>output</tt> is missing. Making a folder
and also all missing intermediate folders is done by <tt>os.makedirs</tt>.
We can write a more general file writing function which takes
a folder name and file name as input and writes the file.
Let us also add some flexibility in the file format: one can either
write a fixed number of characters per line, or have the string on just
one long line. The latter version is specified through <tt>chars_per_line='inf'</tt>
(for infinite number of characters per line).

<P>
The flexible file writing function then becomes

One type of lactose intolerance is called <em>Congenital lactase deficiency</em>.
This is a rare genetic disorder that causes lactose intolerance from birth,
and is particularly common in Finland. The disease is caused by a mutation of
the base in posision 30049 (0-based) of the lactase gene, a mutation from T to
A. Our goal is to check what happens to the protein if this base is mutated.
This is a simple task using the previously developed tools:

As we can see, the translation stops prematurely, creating a much smaller
protein, which will not have the required characteristics of the lactase
protein.

A couple of mutations in a region for LCT located in front of LCT (actually in
the introns of another gene) is the reason for the common lactose intolerance.
That is, the one that sets in for adults only. These mutations control the
expression of the LCT gene, i.e., whether that the gene is turned on or off.
Interestingly, different mutations have evolved in different regions of the
world, e.g., Africa and Northern Europe. This is an example of convergent
evolution: the acquisition of the same biological trait in unrelated
lineages. The prevalence of lactose intolerance varies widely, from around 5%
in northern Europe, to close to 100% in south-east Asia.

<h3>Random Mutations of Genes <a name="bioinf:random"></A></h3>
<P>

<P>

<P>
Mutation of genes
is easily modeled by replacing the letter in a randomly
chosen position of the DNA by a randomly chosen letter.
Python's <tt>random</tt> module can be used
to generate random numbers. Selecting a random position means
generating a random index in the DNA string, and the function
<tt>random.randint(a, b)</tt> generates random integers between <tt>a</tt> and
<tt>b</tt> (both included). Generating a random
letter is easiest done by having a list of the actual letters
and using <tt>random.choice(list)</tt> to pick an arbitrary element from
<tt>list</tt>.
A function for replacing the letter in a randomly selected position (index)
by a random letter among A, C, G, and T is most straightforwardly
implemented by converting the DNA string to a list of letters:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
import random

def mutate(dna):
    dna_list = list(dna)
    mutation_site = random.randint(0, len(dna_list) - 1)

The observed rate at which mutations occur at a given position in the
genome depends on the nucleotide (base) at the position. There are a
number of reasons why the observed mutation rates vary between
different nucleotides. One reason is that there are different
mechanisms generating transitions from one base to another. Another
reason is that there are extensive repair process in living cells, and
the efficiency of this repair mechanism varies for different
nucleotides.  Mutation of nucleotides may be modeled using distinct
probabilities for the transitions from each nucleotide to every other
nucleotide. For example, the probability of replacing A by C may be
prescribed as (say) 0.2. In total we need 4x4 probabilities since each
nucleotide can transform into itself (no change) or three others. The
sum of all four transition probabilities for a given nucleotide must
sum up to one. Such statistical evolution, based on probabilities for
transitioning from one state to another, is known as a Markov process
or Markov chain.

<P>
First we need to set up the probability matrix, i.e., the
4x4 table of probabilities where each row corresponds to the
transition of A, C, G, or T into A, C, G, or T. Say the probability
transition from A to A is 0.2, from A to C is 0.1, from A to G is 0.3,
and from A to T is 0.4. To select a random transiton based on these
probabilities we divide the interval [0,1] into slices whose lengths
correspond to the given probabilities. In this example this means 0,
0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 1. Then we draw a random number in [0,1] and
determine which interval between the slices it lies in. The
probability of hitting an interval equals the transition probability
for the transition corresponding to that interval. For example, if the
random number is 0.33, it belongs to the interval (0.3, 0.6], which
corresponds to the transiton from A to G.

<P>
Let us generate random transition probabilities. That is,
we generate three random numbers to divide the interval [0,1] into
four intervals corresponding to the four possible transitions.
The interval limits, 0, 1, and three random numbers must be sorted
in ascending order to form the intervals. We use the function
<tt>random.random()</tt> to generate random numbers in [0,1):
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
slice_points = sorted(
    [0] + [random.random() for i in range(3)] + [1])
transition_probabilities = [slice_points[i+1] - slice_points[i]
                            for i in range(4)]
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
The transition probabilities are handy to have available as a dictionary:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
markov_chain['A'] = {'A': ..., 'C': ..., 'G': ..., 'T': ...}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
which can be computed by
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
markov_chain['A'] = {base: p for base, p in
                     zip('ATGC', transition_probabilities)}
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
To select a transition, the following <tt>transition</tt> function computes
the interval limits based on the probabilities and checks in which
interval a random number falls:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
def transition(transition_probabilities):
    interval_limits = []
    current_limit = 0

        interval_limits.append((current_limit, to_base))
    r = random.random()
    for limit, to_base in interval_limits:
        if r &lt;= limit:
            return to_base

It is natural to develop a function for checking that the generated
probabilities are consistent, i.e., that they sum up to 1 for each
base:

Exercise <a href="#bioinf:exer:Markov:chain:eff">bioinf:exer:Markov:chain:eff</a> suggests some efficiency

Here is a simulation of mutations using the method based on Markov chains:

Note that the mutated DNA should contain more nucleotides of the
type where the total probability of transitioning into that particular
nucleotide is largest. This total probability is computed by summing
up the columns of the transition probability matrix and dividing by 4:

            for to_base in 'ATGC'}

print transition_into_bases(mc)

</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
These probabilities corresponding to the example run above reads

Transition into T has greatest probability (0.3) and this is also
confirmed by the greatest frequency (0.41).

<h2>Classes for DNA Analysis <a name="bioinf:oo"></A></h2>
<P>

<P>
We shall here exemplify the use of classes for performing
DNA analysis as explained  in the previous text.
Basically, we create a class <tt>Gene</tt> to represent a DNA sequence (string)
and a class <tt>Region</tt> to represent a subsequence (substring), typically an
exon or intron.

<P>
<h3>Class for Regions</h3>
<P>
The class for representing a region of a DNA string is quite simple:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
class Region:
    def __init__(self, dna, start, end):
        self._region = dna[start:end]

    def get_region(self):
        return self._region

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self._region)

    def __eq__(self, other):
        """Check if two Region instances are equal."""
        return self._region == other._region

    def __add__(self, other):
        """Add Region instances: self + other"""
        return self._region + other._region

    def __iadd__(self, other):
        """Increment Region instance: self += other"""
        self._region += other._region
        return self
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Besides storing the substring and giving access to it through <tt>get_region</tt>,
we have also included the possibility to

<P>

<ul>
  <li> say <tt>len(r)</tt> if <tt>r</tt> is a <tt>Region</tt> instance
  <li> check if two <tt>Region</tt> instances are equal
  <li> write <tt>r1 + r2</tt> for two instances <tt>r1</tt> and <tt>r2</tt> of type <tt>Region</tt>
  <li> perform <tt>r1 += r2</tt>
</ul>

The latter two operations are convenient for making one large string out
of all exon or intron regions.

<P>
<h3>Class for Genes</h3>
<P>
The class for gene will be longer and more complex than class
<tt>Region</tt>. We already have a bunch of functions performing various
types of analysis. The idea of the <tt>Gene</tt> class is that these
functions are methods in the class operating on the DNA string and the
exon regions stored in the class.  Rather than recoding all the
functions as methods in the class we shall just let the class "wrap"
the functions. That is, the class methods calls up the functions we
already have.  This approach has two advantages: users can either
choose the function-based or the class-based interface, and the
programmer can reuse all the ready-made functions when implementing
the class.

<P>
The selection of functions include

<P>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>generate_string</tt> for generating a random string from some alphabet
 <li> <tt>download</tt> and <tt>read_dnafile</tt>
   (version <tt>read_dnafile_v1</tt>)
   for downloading data from the Internet and reading from file
 <li> <tt>read_exon_regions</tt> (version <tt>read_exon_regions_v2</tt>)
   for reading exon regions from file
 <li> <tt>tofile_with_line_sep</tt> (version <tt>tofile_with_line_sep_v2</tt>)
   for writing strings to file
 <li> <tt>read_genetic_code</tt> (version <tt>read_genetic_code_v2</tt>) for loading
   the mapping from triplet codes to 1-letter symbols for amino acids
 <li> <tt>get_base_frequencies</tt> (version <tt>get_base_frequencies_v2</tt>)
   for finding frequencies of each base
 <li> <tt>format_frequencies</tt> for formatting base frequencies with two decimals
 <li> <tt>create_mRNA</tt> for computing an mRNA string from DNA and exon regions
 <li> <tt>mutate</tt> for mutating a base at a random position
 <li> <tt>create_markov_chain</tt>, <tt>transition</tt>, and <tt>mutate_via_markov_chain</tt>
   for mutating a base at a random position according to randomly
   generated transition probabilities
 <li> <tt>create_protein_fixed</tt> for proper creation of a protein sequence (string)
</ul>

The set of plain functions for DNA analysis is found
in the file <tt>dna_functions.py</tt> (<a href="http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/doc/tutorial/html/_static/dna_functions.py">download</a> or <a href="http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/doc/tutorial/html/_static/dna_functions.py.html">online viewing</a>), while

of classes <tt>Gene</tt> and <tt>Region</tt>.

<P>
<h4>Basic Features of class Gene</h4>
<P>
Class <tt>Gene</tt> is supposed to hold the DNA sequence and
the associated exon regions. A simple constructor and a few
methods may take the following form:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
from dna_functions import *

class Gene:
    def __init__(self, dna, exon_regions):
        self._dna = dna

        self._exon_regions = exon_regions
        self._exons = []
        for start, end in exon_regions:
            self._exons.append(Region(dna, start, end))

        # Compute the introns (regions between the exons)
        self._introns = []
        prev_end = 0
        for start, end in exon_regions:
            self._introns.append(Region(dna, prev_end, start))
            prev_end = end
        self._introns.append(Region(dna, end, len(dna)))

    def write(self, filename, chars_per_line=70):
        """Write DNA sequence to file with name filename."""
        tofile_with_line_sep(self._dna, filename, chars_per_line)

    def count(self, base):
        """Return no of occurences of base in DNA."""
        return self._dna.count(base)

    def get_base_frequencies(self):
        """Return dict of base frequencies in DNA."""
        return get_base_frequencies(self._dna)

    def format_base_frequencies(self):
        """Return base frequencies formatted with two decimals."""
        return format_base_frequencies(
            self.get_base_frequencies(self._dna))
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Observe how the methods just call up existing functions in
<tt>dna_functions.py</tt>.

<P>
<h4>Flexible Constructor</h4>
<P>
The constructor can be made more flexible. First, the exon regions
may not be known so we should allow <tt>None</tt> as value and in fact
use that as default value. Second, exon regions at the start and/or
end of the DNA string will lead to empty intron <tt>Region</tt> objects so a proper
test on nonzero length of the introns must be inserted.
Third, the data for the DNA string and
the exon regions can either be passed or downloaded and read.
That is,
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->
<pre>
g1 = Gene(dna, exon_regions)  # user has read data from file
g2 = Gene((urlbase, dna_file), (urlbase, exon_file))  # download
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
If the files are already at the computer one can pass <tt>None</tt> for
<tt>urlbase</tt>. The flexible constructor has, not surprisingly, longer
code than the first version (but illustrates well how the
concept of overloaded constructors in other languages, like C++ and Java,
are dealt with in Python):

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->

</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->

<P>
Note that we perform quite detailed testing of the object type
of the data structures supplied as the <tt>dna</tt> and <tt>exon_regions</tt>
arguments. This can well be done to ensure safe use also when there is only
one allowed type per argument.

<P>
<h4>Other Methods</h4>

A <tt>create_mRNA</tt> method, returning the mRNA as a string, can be coded as

some testing whether asking for mRNA is appropriate.

Methods for creating a mutated gene are also included:

Some "get" methods that give access to the fundamental attributes

        return self._introns
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Alternatively, one could access the attributes directly: <tt>gene._dna</tt>,
<tt>gene._exons</tt>, etc. In that case we should remove the leading underscore as
this underscore signifies to the user of the class that these
attributes are considered "protected", i.e., not to be directly accessed
by the user. The "protection" in "get" functions is more mental
than actual since we anyway give the data structures in the hands of
the user.

<P>

<P>
Special methods for the length of a gene, adding genes, checking if
two genes are identical, and printing of compact gene information
are relevant to add:
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->

<h3>Subclasses</h3>
<P>
There are two fundamental types of genes: the most common type which
codes for proteins (indirectly via mRNA) and the type which only codes
for RNA (without being further processed to proteins).
The product of a gene, mRNA or protein, depends on the type of gene we have.
It is then natural to create two subclasses for the two types of
gene and have a method <tt>get_product</tt> which returns the product
of that type of gene.

<P>
The <tt>get_product</tt> method can be declared in class <tt>Gene</tt>:

<P>
<blockquote>    <!-- begin verbatim block   pycod-->

            self.__class__.__name__)
</pre>
</blockquote>   <! -- end verbatim block -->
Note that the exception here will be triggered by an instance (<tt>self</tt>)
of any subclass that just inherits <tt>get_product</tt> from class <tt>Gene</tt>
without implementing a subclass version of this method.

<P>
The two subclasses of <tt>Gene</tt> may take this simple form:
