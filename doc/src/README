The source code for the bioinf-py tutorial is bioinf.do.txt in doconce
format (combined a bit with mako og preprocess for preprocessing stage).
Make sure that only bioinf.do.txt is edited. Most other files are
autogenerated and clean up later.

make.sh: make sphinx, html and latex PDF versions of the document.

make_primer.sh: pick out pieces of tex files for inclusion in a book.

src-bioinf: all scripts and example programs
figs-bioinf: all figures needed in the document

clean.sh: clean up redundant files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Processing of course:

wrap_bioinf.do.txt is the master file, including the core of the text
from bioinf.do.txt.

Running

  doconce format html wrap_bioinf

transforms the document to plain HTML in three stages:

1. preprocess is run to take care of various includes.
2. mako is run to do smart things with if-else depending on how
   the document is to be used (stand-alone, web, book, hardcopy/ebook).
3. doconce translates that text to the output format (html, latex,
   sphinx, pandoc, whatever).
4. tools like sphinx, latex, etc. must be run on the output.
   make.sh automates the process.
