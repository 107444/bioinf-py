[hpl: I don't get what dot plots are good for. Even when comparing two
identical strings the dots don't show a strong correlation (because
there are just 4 letters to choose among the chances of having
the same letter in pos i and j of the two strings is significant.
There should be something visual here.]

[hpl: we should have a real plot with matplotlib here for a somewhat large
string, testing the dotplot numpy function.
I have the code, but need a good illustrative example...]

[hpl: I didn't understand the example under Probability Matrix
in freq.do.txt, i.e., I see that a
probability matrix is given for strings of a certain length,
then we pick out every substring of this length of DNA,
and computes the probability of the sequence of characters in
the substring. But what is it good for?]
