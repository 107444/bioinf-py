idx{bioinformatics}
idx{DNA}

Life is definitely digital. The genetic code of all living organisms
are represented by a long sequence of simple molecules called
nucleotides, or bases, which makes up the Deoxyribonucleic acid,
better known as DNA. There are only four such nucleotides, and the
entire genetic code of a human can be seen as a simple, though 3
billion long, string of the letters A, C, G, and T.  Analyzing DNA
data to gain increased biological understanding is much about
searching in (long) strings for certain string patterns involving the
letters A, C, G, and T.  This is an integral part of *bioinformatics*,
a scientific discipline addressing the use of computers to search
for, explore, and use information about genes, nucleic acids, and
proteins.

label{bioinf:basics}

Below are some very simple examples on DNA analysis that brings together
basic building blocks in programming: loops, `if` tests, and functions.
${primer_book_comment("""We also give a glimpse of programming
constructions that are covered much more in detail later in the book.""")}

===== Counting Letters in DNA Strings =====
label{bioinf:count}

Given some string `dna` containing the letters A, C, G, or T,
representing the bases that make up DNA, we ask the question: how
many times does a certain base occur in the DNA string?
For example, if `dna` is ATGGCATTA and we ask how many times the
base A occur in this string, the answer is 3.

A general Python implementation answering this problem can be done
in many ways. Several possible solutions are presented below.

=== List Iteration ===

idx{list iteration}

The most straightforward solution is to loop over the letters
in the string, test if the current letter equals the desired one,
and if so, increase a counter. Looping over the letters is
obvious if the letters are stored in a list. This is easily
done by converting a string to a list:
!bc ipy
>>> list('ATGC')
['A', 'T', 'G', 'C']
!ec
Our first solution becomes

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v1\(@def count_v2\(dna

=== String Iteration ===

idx{string iteration}

Python allows us to iterate directly over a string without converting
it to a list:
!bc ipy
>>> for c in 'ATGC':
...     print c
A
T
G
C
!ec
In fact, all built-in objects in Python which contain a set of elements in
a particular sequence allow a `for` loop construction of the
type `for element in object`.
#Examples of such objects are
#lists, tuples, strings, arrays, files, dictionaries

A slight improvement of our solution is therefore to iterate directly
over the string:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v2\(dna@def count_v2_demo

We have illustrated two alternative ways of writing out text
where the value of variables are to be inserted in "slots" in the
string.

=== Program Flow ===

It is fundamental for correct programming to understand how
to simulate a program by hand, statement by
statement. Three tools are
effective for helping you reach the required understanding of performing
a simulation by hand:
(i) printing variables, (ii) using a debugger, and (iii) using an
"online program flow tool": "http://people.csail.mit.edu/pgbovine/python/tutor.html".

Inserting `print` statements and examining the about is the
simplest approach to investigating
what is going on:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v2_demo@def count_v3

idx{using a debugger}

# Note: do not use !bc ipy for debugging sessions since
# sphinx treats ipy as interactive sessions and therefore
# drops any environment (it is automatically handled)

An efficient way to explore this program is to run it in a
debugger where we can step through each statement and see what
is printed out. Start `ipython` in a terminal window and run the
program ${link("count_v2_demo.py")} with
a debugger: `run -d count_v2_demo.py`. Use `s` (for step) to
step through each statement, or `n` (for next) for proceeding to the
next statement without stepping through a function that is called.
!bc cod
ipdb> s
> /some/disk/user/bioinf/src/count_v2_demo.py(2)count_v2_demo()
1     1 def count_v1_demo(dna, base):
----> 2     print 'dna:', dna
      3     print 'base:', base

ipdb> s
dna: ATGCGGACCTAT
> /some/disk/user/bioinf/src/count_v2_demo.py(3)count_v2_demo()
      2     print 'dna:', dna
----> 3     print 'base:', base
      4     i = 0 # counter
!ec
Observe the output of the `print` statements. One can also
print a variable explicitly:
!bc cod
ipdb> print base
C
!ec
Misunderstanding of the program flow is one of the most frequent
sources of programming errors, so
whenever in doubt about any program flow, enter a debugger to establish
confidence.

debuggers. Go to the webpage, erase the sample code and paste in your
own code. Press *Visual execution*, then *Forward* to execute
statements one by one. The status of variables are
explained to the right, and the text field below the program shows the output
from `print` statements.  An example is shown in Figure ref{bioinf:fig:pot}.

FIGURE: [figs-bioinf/python_online_tutor.jpg, width=600] Visual execution of a program using the Python Online Tutor. label{bioinf:fig:pot}

=== Index Iteration ===

Although it is natural in Python to iterate over the letters in a
string (or more generally over elements in a sequence), programmers
with experience from other languages (Fortran, C and Java are
examples) are used to `for` loops with an integer counter running over
a all indices in a string or array:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v3@def count_v4

Python indices always start at 0 so the legal indices for our
string become `0`, `1`, ...,
`len(dna)-1`, where `len(dna)` is the number of letters in the
string `dna`. The `range(x)` function returns a list of integers
`0`, `1`, ..., `x-1`, implying that `range(len(dna))` generates
all the legal indices for `dna`.

=== While Loops ===

The `while` loop equivalent to the last function reads

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v4@def count_v5

Correct indentation is here crucial: a typical error is to fail
indenting the `j += 1` line correctly.

=== Summing a Boolean List ===

The idea now is to create a list `m` where `m[i]` is `True` if
`dna[i]` equals the letter we search for (`base`).
The number of `True` values in `m` is then the number of `base`
letters in `dna`. We can use the `sum` function to find
this number because doing arithmetics with boolean lists
automatically interprets `True` as `1` and `False` as `0`.
That is, `sum(m)` returns the number of `True` elements in `m`.
A possible function doing this is

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v5@def count_v6

=== Inline If Test ===

Shorter, more compact code is often a goal if the compactness
enhances readability. The four-line `if` test in the previous
function can be condensed to one line using the inline
`if` construction: `if condition value1 else value2`.

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v6@def count_v7

=== Using Boolean Values Directly ===

The inline `if` test is in fact redundant in the previous function
because the value of the condition `c == base` can be used
directly: it has the value `True` or `False`. This saves
some typing and adds clarity, at least to Python programmers:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v7@def count_v8


=== List Comprehensions ===

idx{list comprehension} idx{`sum`}

Building a list via a `for` loop can often be condensed to one line
by using list comprehensions: `[expr for e in sequence]`, where
`expr` is some expression normally involving the iteration variable
`e`. In our last example, we can introduce a list comprehension

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v8@def count_v9

Here it is tempting to get rid of the `m` variable and
reduce the function body to a single line:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v9@def count_v10

=== Using a Sum Iterator ===

idx{`sum` iterator}

The DNA string is usually huge - 3 billion letters for the human
species. Making a boolean array with `True` and `False` values
therefore increases the memory usage by a factor of two
in our sample functions `count_v5` to `count_v9`.
Summing without actually storing an extra list is desireable.
Fortunately, `sum([x for x in s])` can be replaced
`sum(x for x in s)`, where the latter sums the elements (`x`) in `s`
as `x` visits the elements of `s` one by one. Removing the brackets
therefore avoids first making a list and then applying `sum` on
that list. This is a minor modification of the `count_v9` function:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v10@def count_v11

Below we shall measure the impact of the various program constructs
on the CPU time.

=== Extracting Indices ===

Instead of making a boolean list with elements expressing whether
a character matches the given `base` or not, we may collect all
the indices of the matches. This can be done by adding an `if`
test to the list comprehension:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v11@def count_v12

A debugger or the Python Online Tutorial do not help so much to
understand this compact code. A better approach is to examine
the list comprehension in an interactive Python shell:
!bc ipy
>>> dna = 'AATGCTTA'
>>> base = 'A'
>>> indices = [i for i in range(len(dna)) if dna[i] == base]
>>> indices
[0, 1, 7]
>>> print dna[0], dna[1], dna[7]  # check
A A A
!ec
The element `i` in the list comprehension is only made when
`dna[i] == base`.

=== Using Python's Library ===

Very often when you set out to do a task in Python, there is already
functionality for the task in the object itself, in the Python
libraries, or in third-party libraries found on the Internet.
Counting how many times a character (or substring) `base` appears in a
string `dna` is obviously a very common task so Python supports
it by `dna.count(base)`:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: def count_v12@import random


===== Efficiency Assessment =====
label{bioinf:count:cpu}

Now we have 11 different versions of how to count the occurences
of a letter in a string. Which one of these implementations is the fastest?
To answer the question we need some test data, which should be a
huge string `dna`.

=== Generating Random DNA Strings ===

idx{random strings}

The simplest way of generating a long string is to repeat a
character a large number of times:
!bc pycod
N = 1000000
dna = 'A'*N
!ec
The resulting string is just `'AAA...A`, of length `N`, which is fine
for testing the efficiency of Python functions. Nevertheless, it is
more exciting to work with a DNA string with letters from the whole
alphabet A, C, G, and T. To make a DNA string with a random
composition of the characters we can first make a list of random
characters and then join all those characters to a string:
!bc pycod
import random
alphabet = list('ATGC')
dna = [random.choice(alphabet) for i in range(N)]
dna = ''.join(dna)  # join the character elements to a string
!ec
The `random.choice(x)` function selects an element in the list
`x` at random.

Note that `N` is very often a large number. In Python version 2.x,
`range(N)` generates a list of `N` integers. We can avoid this by
using `xrange` which generates an integer at a time and not the whole
list. In Python version 3.x, the `range` function is actually the
`xrange` function in version 2.x.  Using `xrange`, combining the
statements, and wrapping the construction of a random DNA string in a
function, gives

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: import random@import time

The call `generate_string(10)` may generate something like `AATGGCAGAA`.

=== Measuring CPU Time ===

idx{CPU time measurements}

Our next goal is to see how much time the `count_v9` and `count_v10`
functions spend on counting letters in a huge string as generated
above. Measuring the time spent in a program can be done by the `time`
module:
!bc pycod
import time
...
t0 = time.clock()
# do stuff
t1 = time.clock()
cpu_time = t1 - t0
!ec
The `time.clock()` function returns the CPU time spent in the program since
its start. If the interest is in the total time, also including reading
and writing files, `time.time()` is the appropriate function to call.

Running through all our functions made so far and recording timings can be
done by

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: import time@for cpu_time

In Python, functions are ordinary objects so making a list of
functions is no more special than making a list of strings or numbers.

We can now iterate over `timings` and `functions` simultaneously via `zip`
to make a nice printout of the results:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/count.py fromto: for cpu_time@# Time count

Timings on a MacBook Air 11 running Ubuntu show that
the functions using `list.append` require almost the double of
the time of the functions that work with list comprehensions.
Even faster is the simple iteration over the string.
However, the built-in count functionality of strings
(`dna.count(base)`) runs over 30 times faster than the best of our
handwritten Python functions!
The reason is that the `for` loop needed to count in `dna.count(base)`
is implemented in C and runs very much faster than loops in Python.

A clear lesson learned is: google around before you start out to implement
what seems to be a quite common task. Others have probably already
done it for you, and most likely is their solution much better than what
you can (easily) come up with.

All the functions presented above, including the timings,
can be found in the file ${link('count.py')}.

#=== Testing with Real Data ===

======= Examples from Analyzing DNA =======

We shall here continue the bioinformatics applications started
in Chapter ref{bioinf:basics}. Analysis of DNA sequences is
conveniently done in Python, much with the aid of lists, dictionaries,
string manipulation, and file handling. This will be illustrated
through a series of examples.
% endif

===== Computing Frequencies =====
label{bioinf:freqm}

idx{frequency matrix}

Your genetic code is essentially the same from you are born until you
die, and the same in your blood and your brain.  Which genes that are
turned on and off make the difference between the cells. This
regulation of genes is orchestrated by an immensely complex mechanism,
which we have only started to understand. A central part of this
mechanism consists of molecules called transcription factors that
float around in the cell and attach to DNA, and in doing so turn
nearby genes on or off. These molecules bind preferentially to
specific DNA sequences, and this binding preference pattern can be
represented by a table of frequencies of given symbols at each
position of the pattern.  More precisely, each row in the table
corresponds to the bases A, C, G, and T, while column j reflects how
many times the base appears in position j in the DNA sequence.

For example, if our set of DNA sequences are
TAG, GGT, and GGG, the table becomes

  |------------------|
  | base | 0 | 1 | 2 |
  |--l-----c---c---c-|
  | A    | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  | C    | 0 | 0 | 0 |
  | G    | 2 | 2 | 2 |
  | T    | 1 | 0 | 1 |
  |------------------|

From this table we can read that base A appears once in index 1 in the
DNA strings, base C does not appear at all, base G appears twice in
all positions, and base T appears once in the beginning and end of the
strings.

In the following we shall present different data structures to
hold such a table and different ways of computing them.
The table is known as a *frequency matrix* in bioinformatics,
and this is the term used here too.


=== Separate Frequency Lists ===

Since we know that there are only four rows in the frequency matrix,
an obvious data structure would be four lists, each holding
a row. A function computing these lists may look like

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: def freq_lists@dna_list =

We need to initialize the lists with the right length and a zero
for each element, since each list element is to be used as a counter.
Creating a list of length `n` with object `x` in all positions
is done by `[x]*n`. Finding the proper length is here carried out by
inspecting the length of the first element in `dna_list`, assuming
that all elements have the same length.

In the `for` loop we apply the `enumerate` function which is used
to extract both the element value *and* the element index when
iterating over a sequence. For example,
!bc ipy
>>> for index, base in enumerate(['t', 'e', 's', 't']):
...   print index, base
...
0 t
1 e
2 s
3 t
!ec

Here is a call and printout of the results:
!bc pycod
dna_list = ['GGTAG', 'GGTAC', 'GGTGC']
A, C, G, T = freq_lists(dna_list)
print A
print C
print G
print T
!ec
with output
!bc dat
[0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
[3, 3, 0, 1, 1]
[0, 0, 3, 0, 0]
!ec

=== Nested List ===

The frequency matrix can also be represented as a nested list `M`
such that `M[i][j]` is the frequency of base `i` in position `j`
in the set of DNA strings. Here `i` is an integer, where 0 corresponds to A,
1 to T, 2 to G, and 3 to C. The frequency is the number of times
base `i` appears in position `j` in a set of DNA strings.
Sometimes this number is divided by the number of DNA strings in
the set so that the frequency is between 0 and 1. Note all
the DNA strings must have the same length.

The simplest way to make a nested list is to insert the
`A`, `C`, `G`, and `T` lists into another list:
!bc pycod
>>> frequency_matrix = [A, C, G, T]
>>> frequency_matrix[2][3]
2
>>> G[3]  # same element
2
!ec

Nevertheless, we can illustrate how to compute this type of nested
list directly:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: def freq_list_of_lists_v1@frequency_matrix = freq_list_of_lists_v1\(

As in the case with individual lists we need to initialize all elements
in the nested list to zero.

A call and printout,
!bc pycod
dna_list = ['GGTAG', 'GGTAC', 'GGTGC']
frequency_matrix = freq_list_of_lists_v1(dna_list)
print frequency_matrix
!ec
results in
!bc dat
[[0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [3, 3, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]]
!ec

=== Dictionary for More Convenient Indexing ===

idx{dictionary}

The `if` tests in the `freq_list_of_lists_v1` are somewhat cumbersone,
especially if want to extend the code to other bioinformatics problems
where the alphabet is larger. What we want is a mapping from `base`,
which is a character, to the corresponding index 0, 1, 2, or 3.
A Python dictionary represents such mappings:
!bc ipy
>>> base2index = {'A': 0, 'C': 1, 'G': 2, 'T': 3}
>>> base2index['G']
2
!ec
With the `base2index` dictionary we do not need the series of
`if` tests and the alphabet `'ATGC'` could be much larger
without affecting the length of the code.

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: def freq_list_of_lists_v2@import numpy

=== Numerical Python Array ===

As long as each sublist in a list of lists has the same length, a
list of lists can be replaced by a Numerical Python (`numpy`) array.
Processing of such arrays is often much more efficient than
processing of the nested list data structure.
To initialize a two-dimensional `numpy` array we need to know its
size, here 4 times `len(dna_list[0])`. Only the first line in the function
`freq_list_of_lists_v2` needs to be changed in order to utilize
a `numpy` array:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: import numpy@def freq_dict_of_lists_v1

The resulting `frequency_matrix` object can be indexed as
`[b][i]` or `[b,i]`, with integers `b` and `i`. A typical
indexing is `frequency_matrix[base2index['C'],i]`.

=== Dictionary of Lists ===

Instead of going from a character to an integer index via
`base2index`, we may prefer to index `frequency_matrix` by the base name
and the position index directly: like in`['C'][14]`.
This is the most natural syntax for a user of the
frequency matrix.  The relevant Python data structure is then a
dictionary of lists. That is, `frequency_matrix` is a dictionary with
keys `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`. The value for each key is a
list. Let us now also extend the flexibility such that `dna_list` can
have DNA strings of different lengths. The lists in `frequency_list`
will have lengths equal to the longest DNA string.  A relevant
function is

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: def freq_dict_of_lists_v1@frequency_matrix = freq_dict_of_lists_v1\(

Running

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: frequency_matrix = freq_dict_of_lists_v1@def freq_dict_of_lists_v2
results in the output
!bc dat
{'A': [0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
 'C': [0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
 'G': [3, 3, 0, 1, 1],
 'T': [0, 0, 3, 0, 0]}
!ec

The initialization of `frequency_matrix` in the above code can
be made more compact by using a dictionary comprehension:
!bc pycod
dict = {key: value for key in some_sequence}
!ec
Here,
!bc pycod
frequency_matrix = {base: [0]*n for base in 'ACGT'}
!ec
Adopting this construction in the `freq_dict_of_lists_v1` function
leads to a slightly more compact version,

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: def freq_dict_of_lists_v2@def freq_dict_of_dicts_v1

=== Dictionary of Dictionaries ===

The dictionary of lists data structure can alternatively be replaced
by a dictionary of dictionaries object, often just called a dict of
dicts object. That is, `frequency_matrix[base]` is a dictionary with
key `i` and value equal to the added number of occurences of `base` in
`dna[i]` for all `dna` strings in the list `dna_list`.  The indexing
`frequency_matrix['C'][i]` and the values are exactly as in the last
example; the only difference is whether `frequency_matrix['C']` is a
list or dictionary.

Our function working with `frequency_matrix` as a dict of dicts
is written

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: def freq_dict_of_dicts_v1@from collections import default

=== Using Dictionaries with Default Values ===

The manual initialization of each subdictionary to zero,
!bc pycod
    frequency_matrix = {base: {index: 0 for index in range(n)}
                        for base in 'ACGT'}
!ec
can be simplified by using a dictionary with default values for any
key. The construction `defaultdict(lambda: obj)`
makes a dictionary with `obj` as default value.
This construction simplifies the previous function a bit:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: from collections import default@_matrix = freq_list_of_lists_v2

__Remark.__
Dictionary comprehensions were new in Python 2.7 and 3.1, but can be
simulated in earlier versions by making (key, value) tuples via
list comprehensions. A dictionary comprehension
!bc pycod
d = {key: value for key in sequence}
!ec
is then constructed as
!bc pycod
d = dict([(key, value) for key in sequence])
!ec

=== Using Arrays and Vectorization ===

The dict of lists data structure for `frequency_matrix` can easily be
changed to a dict of `numpy` arrays: just replace the initialization
`[0]*n` by `np.zeros(n, dtype=np.int)`. The indexing remains the same:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: def freq_dict_of_arrays_v1@def freq_dict_of_arrays_v2

Having `frequency_matrix[base]` as a `numpy` array instead of a list
does not give any immediate advantage, as the storage and CPU time is
about the same. The loop over the `dna` string and the associated
indexing is what consumes all the CPU time.  However, the `numpy`
arrays provides a potential for increasing efficiency through
vectorization, i.e., replacing the element-wise operations on `dna`
and `frequency_matrix[base]` by operations on the whole arrays at
once.

Let us use the interactive Python shell to
explore the possibilities of vectorization.
We first convert the string to a `numpy` array of characters:
!bc pycod
>>> dna = 'ACAT'
>>> dna = np.array(dna, dtype='c')
>>> dna
array(['A', 'C', 'A', 'T'],
      dtype='|S1')
!ec
For a given base, say A, we can in one vectorized operation find
which locations in `dna` that contain `A`:
!bc pycod
>>> b = dna == 'A'
>>> b
array([ True, False,  True, False], dtype=bool)
!ec
By converting `b` to an integer array `i` we can
update the frequency counts
for all indices by adding `i` to `frequency_matrix['A']`:
!bc pycod
>>> i = np.asarray(b, dtype=np.int)
>>> i
array([1, 0, 1, 0])
>>> frequency_matrix['A'] = frequency_matrix['A'] + i
!ec
This recipe can be repeated for all bases:
!bc pycod
    for dna in dna_list:
        dna = np.array(dna, dtype='c')
        for base in 'ACGT':
            b = dna == base
            i = np.asarray(b, dtype=np.int)
            frequency_matrix[base] = frequency_matrix[base] + i
!ec
It turns out that we do not need to convert the boolean array `b`
to an integer array `i`, because doing arithmetics with `b` directly
is possible: `False` is interpreted as 0 and `True` as 1 in arithmetic
operations.  We can also use
the `+=` operator to update all elements of `frequency_matrix[base]`
directly, without first computing the sum of two arrays
`frequency_matrix[base] + i` and then assigning this result to
`frequency_matrix[base]`.
Collecting all these ideas in one function yields the code

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: def freq_dict_of_arrays_v2@# ----

This vectorized function runs almost 10 times as fast as the
(scalar) counterpart `freq_list_of_arrays_v1`!

label{bioinf:freq:analysis}

Having built a frequency matrix out of a collection of DNA strings, it
is time to use it for analysis.
The short DNA strings that a frequency matrix is built out of, is
typically a set of substrings of a larger DNA sequence, which shares
some common purpose. An example of this is to have a set of substrings
that serves as a kind of anchors/magnets at which given molecules
attach to DNA and perform biological functions (like turning genes on
or off). With the frequency matrix constructed from a limited set of
known anchor locations (substrings), we can now scan for other similar
substrings that have the potential to perform the same function. The
simplest way to do this is to first determine the most typical
substring according to the frequency matrix, i.e., the substring having
the most frequent nucleotide at each position. This is referred to as
the consensus string of the frequency matrix. We can then look for
occurrences of the consensus substring in a larger DNA sequence, and
consider these occurrences as likely candidates for serving the same
function (e.g., as anchor locations for molecules).

For instance,
given three substrings ACT, CCA and AGA, the frequency matrix
would be (list of lists, with rows corresponding to A, C, G, and T):
!bc dat
[[2, 0, 2]
 [1, 2, 0]
 [0, 1, 0]
 [0, 0, 1]]
!ec
We see that for position 0,
which corresponds to the left-most columnin the table, the symbol A has the
highest frequency (2). The maximum frequencies for the other positions
are seen to be C for position 1, and A for position 2. The consensus
string is therefore ACA.  Note that the consensus string does not need to be
equal to any of the substrings that formed the basis of the frequency
matrix (this is indeed the case for the above example).


=== List of Lists Frequency Matrix ===

Let `frequency_matrix` be a list of lists. For each position `i` we
run through the "rows" in the frequency matrix and keep track of the
maximum frequency value and the corresponding letter. If two or
more letters have the same frequency value we use a dash to
indicate that this position in the consensus string is undetermined.

The following function computes the consensus string:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: def find_consensus_v1@def find_consensus_v2

Since this code requires `frequency_matrix` to be a list of lists
we should insert a test and raise an exception if the
type is wrong:
!bc pycod
def find_consensus_v1(frequency_matrix):
    if isinstance(frequency_matrix, list) and \
       isinstance(frequency_matrix[0], list):
        pass # right type
    else:
        raise TypeError('frequency_matrix must be list of lists')
...
!ec

=== Dict of Dicts Frequency Matrix ===

How must the `find_consensus_v1` function be altered if `frequency_matrix`
is a dict of dicts?

  o The `base2index` dict is no longer needed.
  o Access of sublist, `frequency_matrix[0]`, to test for type and
    length of the strings, must be replaced
    by `frequency_matrix['A']`.

The updated function becomes

@@@CODE src-bioinf/freq.py fromto: def find_consensus_v3@frequency_matrix = freq_dict_of_dicts_v1

Here is a test:
!bc pycod
frequency_matrix = freq_dict_of_dicts_v1(dna_list)
pprint.pprint(frequency_matrix)
print find_consensus_v3(frequency_matrix)
!ec
with output
!bc dat
{'A': {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 2, 4: 0},
 'C': {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 2},
 'G': {0: 3, 1: 3, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 1},
 'T': {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 3, 3: 0, 4: 0}}
Consensus string: GGTAC
!ec

Let us try `find_consensus_v3` with the dict of defaultdicts
as input (`freq_dicts_of_dicts_v2`). The code runs fine, but
the output string is just `G`!
The reason is that `dna_length` is 1, and therefore that the length of
the `A` dict in `frequency_matrix` is 1.
Printing out `frequency_matrix` yields
!bc pycod
{'A': defaultdict(X, {3: 2}),
 'C': defaultdict(X, {4: 2}),
 'G': defaultdict(X, {0: 3, 1: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1}),
 'T': defaultdict(X, {2: 3})}
!ec
where our `X` is a short form for text like
!bc pycod
`<function <lambda> at 0xfaede8>`
!ec
We see that the length of a defaultdict will only count the nonzero
entries. Hence, to use a defaultdict our function must get the length of the DNA string to
build as an extra argument:
!bc pycod
def find_consensus_v4(frequency_matrix, dna_length):
    ...
!ec

Exercise ref{bioinf:exer:freq:fargs} suggest to make a unified
`find_consensus` function which works with all of the different
representation of `frequency_matrix` that we have used.

The functions making and using the frequency matrix are found
in the file ${link('freq.py')}.

===== Probability Matrix =====

*UNFINISHED!*

[hpl: I didn't understand this example, i.e., I see that a
probability matrix is given for strings of a certain length,
then we pick out every substring of this length of DNA,
and computes the probability of the sequence of characters in
the substring. But what is it good for?]

!bc pycod
DNA='ATCTGATCAA'
probabilityMatrix={'A': {0: 0.2, 1: 0.2, 2: 0.6, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.2},
                  'C': {0: 0.2, 1: 0.4, 2: 0.0, 3: 0.0, 4: 0.8},
                  'T': {0: 0.2, 1: 0.0, 2: 0.2, 3: 0.6, 4: 0.0},
                  'G': {0: 0.4, 1: 0.4, 2: 0.2, 3: 0.2, 4: 0.0}}

len_window=len(probabilityMatrix['A'])

probabilitiesList=[]
for num in range(len(DNA)-len_window+1):
    substring=DNA[num:num+len_window]

    prob_value=1
    for index, value in enumerate(substring):
       prob_value *=probabilityMatrix[value][index]

    probabilitiesList.append(prob_value)

print probabilitiesList
!ec


===== Dot Plots from Pair of DNA Sequences =====
label{bioinf:dotplot}

[hpl: I don't get what dot plots are good for. Even when comparing two
identical strings the dots don't show a strong correlation (because
there are just 4 letters to choose among the chances of having
the same letter in pos i and j of the two strings is significant.
There should be something visual here.]

Dot plots are commonly used to visualize the similarity between two protein or
nucleic acid sequences. They compare two sequences, say `d1` and `d2`,
by organizing `d1`
along the x-axis and `d2` along the y-axis of a plot.
When `d1[i] == d2[j]` we mark this by drawing a dot at location
`i,j` in the plot. An example is
!bc dat
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
!ec
The origin is in the upper left corner, which means that the
first string has its indices running to the right 0, 1, 2, and so forth,
while the second string has its indices running down, row by row.

In the forthcoming examples, a dot is represented by 1. No presence at
a given location is represented by 0. A dot plot can be manually read
to find common patterns between two sequences that has undergone
several insertions and deletions, and it serves as a conceptual basis
for algorithms that align two sequences in order to find evolutionary
origin or shared functional parts. Such alignment of biological
sequences is a particular variant of finding the edit distance between
strings, which is a general technique, also used for, e.g., spell
correction in search engines.

The dot plot data structure must mimic a table.  The "x" direction is
along rows, while the "y" direction is along columns. First we need to
initialize the whole data structure with zeros. Then, for each for
each position in the "x string" we run through all positions in the "y
string" and mark those where the characters match with 1.
The algorithm will be clear when presented with specific Python code.

=== Using Lists of Lists ===

Since the plot is essentially a table, a list of lists is therefore
a natural data structure. The following function creates the
list of lists:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dotplot.py fromto: def dotplot_list_of_lists@dna_x = 'T

To view the dot plot we need to print out the list of lists. Here
is a possible way:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dotplot.py fromto: dna_x = 'T@def make_string

The output becomes
!bc dat
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
!ec

One can, alternatively, translate the list of lists to a multi-line string
containing the whole plot as a string object.
This implies joining all the characters in each row and then joining
all the rows:
!bc pycod
rows = [' '.join(row) for row in dotplot_matrix]
plot = '\n'.join(rows)
# or combined
plot = '\n'.join([' '.join(row) for row in dotplot_matrix])
!ec
${not_primer_book_comment("""The construction `'d'.join(l)` joints
all the string elements of the
list `l` and inserts `d` as delimiter: `'x'.join(['A','B','C'])`
becomes `'AxBxC'`.""")}
We use a space as delimiter among the characters in a row since this
gives a nice layout when printing the string. All rows are joined with
newline as delimiter such that the rows appear on separate lines when
printing the string.  To really understand what is going on, a more
comprehensive code could be made so that each step can be examined:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dotplot.py fromto: def make_string_expanded@# end of testing join operations in detail

Unless the join operation as used here is well understood, it is highly
recommended to paste the above code into the "Python Online Tutor": "http://people.csail.mit.edu/pgbovine/python/tutor.html", step
through the code, and watch how variables change their content.
Figure ref{bioinf:fig:pot2} shows a snapshot of this type of code investigation.

FIGURE: [figs-bioinf/pot_join.jpg, width=850] Illustration of how join operations work ("Python Online Tutor": "http://people.csail.mit.edu/pgbovine/python/tutor.html"). label{bioinf:fig:pot2}

=== Using Numerical Python Arrays ===

A Numerical Python array, with integer elements that equal 0 or 1,
is well suited as data structure to hold a dot plot.

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dotplot.py fromto: def dotplot_numpy@dna_x = 'ATT

[hpl: we should have a real plot with matplotlib here for a somewhat large
string. I have the code, but need a good illustrative example...]

The two dot plot functions are available
in the file ${link('dotplot.py')}.

===== Finding Base Frequencies =====
label{bioinf:basefreq}

DNA consists of four molecules called nucleotides, or bases, and can
be represented as a string of the letters A, C, G, and T. But this
does not mean that all four nucleotides need to be similarly
frequent. Are some nucleotides more frequent than others, say in
yeast, as represented by the first chromosome of yeast? Also, DNA is
really not a single thread, but two threads wound together.  This
wounding is based on an A from one thread binding to a T of the other
thread, and C binding to G (that is, A will only bind with T, not with
C or G).  Could this fact force groups of the four symbol frequencies
to be equal?  The answer is that the A-T and G-C binding does not in principle
force certain frequencies to be equal, but in practice they usually
become so because of evolutionary factors related to this pairing.

The first task is to compute the frequencies of the bases
A, C, G, and T. That is, the number of times each base occurs
in the DNA string, divided by the length of the string.
For example, if the DNA string is ACGGAAA, the length is 7, A appears
4 times with frequency 4/7, C appears once with frequency 1/7,
G appears twice with frequency 2/7, and T does not appear so the
frequency is 0.

From a coding perspective we may create a function for counting how
many times A, C, G, and T appears in the string and then another
function for computing the frequencies. In both cases we want
dictionaries such that we can index with the character and get the
count or the frequency out.
Counting is done by

@@@CODE src-bioinf/basefreq.py fromto: def get_base_counts@get_base_frequencies_v1
This function can then be used to compute the base frequencies:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/basefreq.py fromto: get_base_frequencies_v1@get_base_frequencies_v2
Since we learned at the end of Section ref{bioinf:count:cpu} that
`dna.count(base)` was much faster than the various manual
implementations of counting, we can write a faster and simpler
function for computing all the base frequencies:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/basefreq.py fromto: def get_base_frequencies_v2@dna = 'ACCAGAGT'
A little test,

@@@CODE src-bioinf/basefreq.py fromto: dna = 'ACCAGAGT'@assert get_base_frequencies_v1
gives the result
!bc dat
Base frequencies of sequence 'ACCAGAGT':
A: 0.38, C: 0.25, T: 0.12, G: 0.25
!ec
The `format_frequencies` function was made for nice printout of
the frequencies with 2 decimals. The one-line code is an effective
combination of a dictionary, list comprehension, and the
`join` functionality. The latter is used to get a comma correctly
inserted between the items in the result. Lazy programmers would
probably just do a `print frequencies` and live with the
curly braces in the output and (in general) 16 disturbing decimals.

idx{`urllib`}

We can try the frequency computation on real data. The file
!bc
http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/doc/src/data/yeast_chr1.txt
!ec
contains the DNA for yeast. We can download this file from
the Internet by
!bc pycod
urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename=name_of_local_file)
!ec
where `url` is the Internet address of the file and `name_of_local_file`
is a string containing the name of the file on the computer where the
file is downloaded.
To avoid repeated downloads when the program is run multiple times,
we insert a test on whether the local file exists or not. The
call `os.path.isfile(f)` returns `True` if a file with name `f` exists
in the current working folder.

The appropriate download code then becomes

@@@CODE src-bioinf/basefreq.py fromto: import urllib@def read_dnafile_v1
A copy of the file on the Internet is now in the current working folder
under the name `yeast_chr1.txt`.
${primer_book_comment(r"""(See Chapter ref{sec:files:urllib} for
more information about \emp{urllib} and downloading files from
the Internet.)""")}

The `yeast_chr1.txt` files contains the DNA string split over many lines.
We therefore need to read the lines in this file, strip each line to
remove the trailing newline, and join all the stripped lines to
recover the DNA string:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/basefreq.py fromto: def read_dnafile_v1@def read_dnafile_v2

As usual, an alternative programming solution can be devised:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/basefreq.py fromto: def read_dnafile_v2@assert get_base_freq

The output becomes
!bc dat
Base frequencies of yeast DNA (length 230208):
A: 0.30, C: 0.19, T: 0.30, G: 0.20
!ec
The varying frequency of different nucleotides in DNA is referred to
as nucleotide bias. The nucleotide bias varies between organisms, and
have a range of biological implications. For many organisms the
nucleotide bias has been highly optimized through evolution and
reflects characteristics of the organisms and their environments, for
instance the typical temperature the organism is adapted to.
${not_primer_book_comment("""The
interested reader can, e.g., find more details in
"this article": "http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v6/n12/full/7400538.html".
""")}

#This shows that A and T appears in the yeast DNA with 50 percent higher
#probability than C and G.

The functions computing base frequencies are available
in the file ${link('basefreq.py')}.

===== Translating Genes into Proteins ======
label{bioinf:gene2protein}

An important usage of DNA is for cells to store information on their
arsenal of proteins. Briefly, a gene is, in essence, a region of the
DNA, consisting of several coding parts (called exons), interspersed
by non-coding parts (called introns).  The coding parts are
concatenated to form a string called mRNA, where also occurrences of
the letter T in the coding parts are substituted by a U. A triplet of
mRNA letters code for a specific amino acid, which are the building
blocks of proteins. Consecutive triplets of letters in mRNA in this
way define a specific sequence of amino acids, which amounts to a
certain protein.  Here is an example of using the mapping from DNA to
proteins to create the Lactase protein (LPH), using the DNA sequence
of the Lactase gene (LCT) as underlying code. An important functional
property of LPH is in diguesting Lactose which is found most notably
in milk. Lack of the functionality of LPH leads to digestive problems
referred to as lactose intolerance. Most mammals and humans lose their
expression of LCT and therefore their ability to digest milk when they
stop recieving breast milk.

The file
!bc
http://hplgit.github.com/bioinf-py/doc/src/data/genetic_code.tsv
!ec
contains a mapping of genetic codes to amino acids.
The file format takes the form
!bc dat
UUU     F       Phe     Phenylalanine
UUC     F       Phe     Phenylalanine
UUA     L       Leu     Leucine
UUG     L       Leu     Leucine
CUU     L       Leu     Leucine
CUC     L       Leu     Leucine
CUA     L       Leu     Leucine
CUG     L       Leu     Leucine
AUU     I       Ile     Isoleucine
AUC     I       Ile     Isoleucine
AUA     I       Ile     Isoleucine
AUG     M       Met     Methionine (Start)
!ec
The first column is the genetic code (triplet in mRNA),
while the other columns represent
various ways of expressing the corresponding amino acid:
a 1-letter symbol, a 3-letter name, and the full name.

Downloading the `genetic_code.tsv` file can be done by
this robust function:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/genes2proteins.py fromto: def download@def read_genetic_code_v1

We want to make a dictionary of this file that maps the code (first
column) on to the 1-letter name (second column):

@@@CODE src-bioinf/genes2proteins.py fromto: def read_genetic_code_v1@urlbase = 'http

Downloading the
file, reading it and making the dictionary are done by

@@@CODE src-bioinf/genes2proteins.py fromto: urlbase = 'http@def read_genetic_code_v2

Not surprisingly, the `read_genetic_code_v1` can be made much shorter
by collecting the first two columns as list of 2-lists and then
converting the 2-lists to key-value pairs in a dictionary:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/genes2proteins.py fromto: def read_genetic_code_v2@code2 =

Creating a mapping of the code onto all the three variants of the amino
acid name is
also of interest. For example, we would like to make look ups like
`['CUU']['3-letter']` or `['CUU']['amino acid']`. This requires
a dictionary of dictionaries:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/genes2proteins.py fromto: def read_genetic_code_v3@def read_genetic_code_v4
An alternative way of writing the last function is

@@@CODE src-bioinf/genes2proteins.py fromto: def read_genetic_code_v4@code = read_genetic_code_v3

To form mRNA, we need to grab the exon regions (the coding parts) of
the lactase gene.  These regions are substrings of the lactase gene
DNA string, corresponding to the start and end positions of the exon
regions.  Then we must replace T by U, and combine all the substrings
to build the mRNA string.

Two straightforward subtasks are to load the lactase gene and its exon
positions into variables.  The file `lactase_gene.txt`, at the same
Internet location as the other files, stores the lactase gene. The file
has the same format as `yeast_chr1.txt`. Using the `download` function
and the previously shown `read_dnafile_v1`, we can easily load the
data in the file into the string `lactase_gene`.

The exon regions are described in a file `lactase_exon.tsv`, also
found at the same Internet site as the other files. The file is easily
downloaded by calling `download`.  The file format is very simple in
that each line holds the start and end positions of an exon region:
!bc dat
0       651
3990    4070
7504    7588
13177   13280
15082   15161
!ec
We want to have this information available in a list of (start,end)
tuples. The following function does the job:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/genes2proteins.py fromto: def read_exon_regions_v1@def read_exon_regions_v2
Readers favoring compact code will appreciate this alternative version
of the function:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/genes2proteins.py fromto: def read_exon_regions_v2@print 'Start and end position

For simplicity's sake, we shall consider mRNA as the concatenation of exons,
although in reality, additional base pairs are added to each end.
Having the lactase gene as a string and the exon regions as a list of
(start,end) tuples, it is straightforward to extract the regions
as substrings, replace T by U, and add all the substrings together:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/genes2proteins.py fromto: def create_mRNA@print '10 last

We would like to store the mRNA string in a file, using the same
format as `lactase_gene.txt` and `yeast_chr1.txt`, i.e.,
the string is split on multiple lines with, e.g., 70 characters per line.
An appropriate function doing this is

@@@CODE src-bioinf/genes2proteins.py fromto: def tofile_with_line_sep_v1@tofile_with_line_sep_v2

It might be convenient to have a separate folder for files that we create.
Python has good support for testing if a folder exists, and if not,
make a folder:
!bc pycod
output_folder = 'output'
if not os.path.isdir(output_folder):
    os.mkdir(output_folder)
filename = os.path.join(output_folder, 'lactase_mrna.txt')
tofile_with_line_sep_v1(mrna, filename)
!ec
Python's term for folder is directory, which explains why `isdir` is
the function name for testing on a folder existence. Observe
especially that the combination of a folder and a filename is done via
`os.path.join` rather than just inserting a forward slash, or backward
slash on Windows: `os.path.join` will insert the right slsah, forward
or backward, depending on the current operating system.

Occasionally, the output folder is nested, say
!bc pycod
output_folder = os.path.join('output', 'lactase')
!ec
In that case, `os.mkdir(output_folder)` may fail because
the intermediate folder `output` is missing. Making a folder
and also all missing intermediate folders is done by `os.makedirs`.
We can write a more general file writing function which takes
a folder name and file name as input and writes the file.
Let us also add some flexibility in the file format: one can either
write a fixed number of characters per line, or have the string on just
one long line. The latter version is specified through `chars_per_line='inf'`
(for infinite number of characters per line).

The flexible file writing function then becomes

@@@CODE src-bioinf/genes2proteins.py fromto: def tofile_with_line_sep_v2@tofile_with_line_sep_v2\(mrna

To create the protein, we replace the triplets of the mRNA strings
by the corresponding 1-letter name as specified in the
`genetic_code.tsv` file.

@@@CODE src-bioinf/genes2proteins.py fromto: def create_protein\(@lactase_protein\.txt


Unfortunately, this first try to simulate this translation process is
incorrect. The problem is that the translation always begins with the
amino acid Methionine, code AUG, and ends when one of the stop codons
is met. We must thus check for the correct start and stop criterias.
A fix is

@@@CODE src-bioinf/genes2proteins.py fromto: def create_protein_fixed@congential_lactase_deficiency
The output, needed below for comparison, becomes
!bc dat

Lenght of the correct protein:  1927
!ec

===== Some Humans Can Drink Milk, While Others Cannot ======
label{bioinf:lactase:milk}

One type of lactose intolerance is called *Congenital lactase deficiency*.
This is a rare genetic disorder that causes lactose intolerance from birth,
and is particularly common in Finland. The disease is caused by a mutation of
the base in posision 30049 (0-based) of the lactase gene, a mutation from T to
A. Our goal is to check what happens to the protein if this base is mutated.
This is a simple task using the previously developed tools:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/genes2proteins.py fromto: def congential_lactase_d@

The output, to be compared with the non-mutated gene above, is now
!bc dat
10 last amino acids of the mutated lactase protein: GFIWSAASAA
Lenght of the mutated lactase protein: 1389
!ec
As we can see, the translation stops prematurely, creating a much smaller
protein, which will not have the required characteristics of the lactase
protein.

A couple of mutations in a region for LCT located in front of LCT (actually in
the introns of another gene) is the reason for the common lactose intolerance.
That is, the one that sets in for adults only. These mutations control the
expression of the LCT gene, i.e., whether that the gene is turned on or off.
Interestingly, different mutations have evolved in different regions of the
world, e.g., Africa and Northern Europe. This is an example of convergent
evolution: the acquisition of the same biological trait in unrelated
lineages. The prevalence of lactose intolerance varies widely, from around 5%
in northern Europe, to close to 100% in south-east Asia.

===== Random Mutations of Genes ======
label{bioinf:random}

=== A Simple Mutation Model ===

${primer_book_comment("""
A fundamental principle of biological evolution is that DNA undergoes
mutation. Since DNA can be represented as a string consisting of the
letters A, C, G, and T, as explained in Section ref{bioinf:basics},
mutation of DNA""")}
${not_primer_book_comment("""Mutation of genes""")}
is easily modeled by replacing the letter in a randomly
chosen position of the DNA by a randomly chosen letter.
${not_primer_book_comment("""Python's `random` module can be used
to generate random numbers. Selecting a random position means
generating a random index in the DNA string, and the function
`random.randint(a, b)` generates random integers between `a` and
`b` (both included). Generating a random
letter is easiest done by having a list of the actual letters
and using `random.choice(list)` to pick an arbitrary element from
`list`.""")}
A function for replacing the letter in a randomly selected position (index)
by a random letter among A, C, G, and T is most straightforwardly
implemented by converting the DNA string to a list of letters:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: import random@def get_base_frequencies_v2

Using the functions `get_base_frequencies_v2` and `format_frequencies`
from Section ref{bioinf:basefreq}, we can easily mutate a gene a number
of times and see how the frequencies of the bases A, C, G, and T change:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: dna = 'AC@# Vectorized version

Here is the output from a run:
!bc dat
Starting DNA: ACGGAGATTTCGGTATGCAT
A: 0.25, C: 0.15, T: 0.30, G: 0.30
DNA after 10000 mutations: AACCAATCCGACGAGGAGTG
A: 0.35, C: 0.25, T: 0.10, G: 0.30
!ec

=== Vectorized Version ===

The efficiency of the `mutate_v1` function with its surrounding loop can be
significantly increased up by performing all the mutations at
once using `numpy` arrays. This speed-up is of interest for long `dna`
strings and many mutations. The idea is to draw all the mutation sites
at once, and also all the new bases at these sites at once.
The `np.random` module provides functions for drawing several random
numbers at a time, but only integers and real numbers can be drawn,
not characters from the alphabet A, C, G, and T. We therefore have
to simulate these four characters by the numbers (say) 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Afterwards we can translate the integers to letters by some clever
vectorized indexing.

Drawing `N` mutation sites is a matter of drawing `N` random
integers among the legal indices:
!bc pycod
import numpy as np
mutation_sites = np.random.random_integers(0, len(dna)-1, size=N)
!ec
Drawing `N` bases, represented as the integers 0-3, is similarly done by
!bc pycod
new_bases_i = np.random.random_integers(0, 3, N)
!ec
Converting say the integers 1 to the base symbol C is done by
picking out the indices (in a boolean array) where `new_bases_i`
equals 1, and inserting the character `'C'` in a companion
array of characters:
!bc pycod
new_bases_c = np.zeros(N, dtype='c')
indices = new_bases_i == 1
new_bases_c[indices] = 'C'
!ec
We must do this integer-to-letter conversion for all four integers/letters.
Thereafter, `new_bases_c` must be inserted in `dna` for all the
!bc pycod
dna[mutation_sites] = new_bases_c
!ec
The final step is to convert the `numpy` array of characters `dna`
back to a standard string by first converting `dna` to a list
and then joining the list elements: `''.join(dna.tolist())`.

The complete vectorized functions can now be expressed as follows:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: import numpy as np@dna = mutate_v2\(dna

It is of interest to time `mutate_v2` versus `mutate_v1`. For this purpose
we need a long test string. A straightforward generation of random
letters is

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: def generate_string_v1@def generate_string_v2

A vectorized version of this function can also be made, using the
ideas explored above for the `mutate_v2` function:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: def generate_string_v2@def time_mutate

The `time_mutate` function in the file ${link('mutate.py')} performs
timing of the generation of test strings and the mutations.  For a DNA
string of length 100,000 the vectorized function is about 8 times
faster. With 10,000 mutations on this string, the vectorized version
is almost 3000 times faster! These numbers stay approximately the same
also for larger strings and more mutations.  This case study on
vectorization is a striking example on the fact that a straightforward
and convenient function like `mutate_v1` might occasionally be very
slow for large-scale computations.

=== A Markov Chain Model ===

The observed rate at which mutations occur at a given position in the
genome is not independent of the type of nucleotide (base) at that
position, as was assumed in the previous simple mutation model.  We
should therefore take into account that the rate of transition depends
on the base.

There are a number of reasons why the observed mutation rates vary
between different nucleotides. One reason is that there are different
mechanisms generating transitions from one base to another. Another
reason is that there are extensive repair process in living cells, and
the efficiency of this repair mechanism varies for different
nucleotides.  Mutation of nucleotides may be modeled using distinct
probabilities for the transitions from each nucleotide to every other
nucleotide. For example, the probability of replacing A by C may be
prescribed as (say) 0.2. In total we need 4x4 probabilities since each
nucleotide can transform into itself (no change) or three others. The
sum of all four transition probabilities for a given nucleotide must
sum up to one. Such statistical evolution, based on probabilities for
transitioning from one state to another, is known as a Markov process
or Markov chain.

First we need to set up the probability matrix, i.e., the
$4\times4$|$4x4$ table of probabilities where each row corresponds to the
transition of A, C, G, or T into A, C, G, or T. Say the probability
transition from A to A is 0.2, from A to C is 0.1, from A to G is 0.3,
and from A to T is 0.4. To select a random transiton based on these
probabilities we divide the interval $[0,1]$ into slices whose lengths
correspond to the given probabilities. In this example this means $0,
0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 1$. Then we draw a random number in $[0,1]$ and
determine which interval between the slices it lies in. The
probability of hitting an interval equals the transition probability
for the transition corresponding to that interval. For example, if the
random number is 0.33, it belongs to the interval $(0.3, 0.6]$, which
corresponds to the transiton from A to G.

Let us generate random transition probabilities. That is,
we generate three random numbers to divide the interval $[0,1]$ into
four intervals corresponding to the four possible transitions.
The interval limits, 0, 1, and three random numbers must be sorted
in ascending order to form the intervals. We use the function
`random.random()` to generate random numbers in $[0,1)$:
!bc pycod
slice_points = sorted(
    [0] + [random.random() for i in range(3)] + [1])
transition_probabilities = [slice_points[i+1] - slice_points[i]
                            for i in range(4)]
!ec
The transition probabilities are handy to have available as a dictionary:
!bc pycod
markov_chain['A'] = {'A': ..., 'C': ..., 'G': ..., 'T': ...}
!ec
which can be computed by
!bc pycod
markov_chain['A'] = {base: p for base, p in
                     zip('ACGT', transition_probabilities)}
!ec
To select a transition, we need to draw a random letter
(A, C, G, or T) according to the probababilities
`markov_chain[b]` where `b` is the base at the current position.
Actually, this is a very common operation, namely drawing a
random value from a *discrete probability distribution* (`markov_chain[b]`).
The natural approach is therefore write a general function for
drawing from any discrete probability distribution given as
a dictionary:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: def draw\(@def draw_vec

Basically, the algorithm divides [0,1] into intervals of lengths
equal to the probabilities of the various outcomes and checks
which interval is hit by a random variable in [0,1]. The corresponding
value is the random choice.

A complete function creating all the transition probabilities and
storing them in a dictionary of dictionaries takes the form

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: def create_markov@def test_transition_probabilities

It is natural to develop a function for checking that the generated
probabilities are consistent. The transition from a particular base
into one of the four bases happens with probability 1, which means that
the probabilities in a row must sum up to 1:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: def test_transition@probabilities\(mc

Another test is to check that `draw` actually draws random values
in accordance with the underlying probabilities. To this end, we draw
a large number of values, `N`, count the frequencies of the various values,
divide by `N` and compare the empirical normalized frequencies
with the probabilities:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: def test_draw_approx@def test_draw_vec_approx
This test is only approximate, but does bring evidence to the correctness
of the implementation of the `draw` function.

A vectorized version of `draw` can also be made. We refer to the
source code file ${link("mutate.py")} for details (the function is relatively
complicated).

Now we have all the tools needed to run the Markov chain of
transitions for a randomly selected position in a DNA sequence:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: def mutate_via@dna = 'TTACGGAGATTTCGGTATGCAT'
Exercise ref{bioinf:exer:Markov:chain:eff} suggests some efficiency
enhancements of simulating mutations via these functions.

Here is a simulation of mutations using the method based on Markov chains:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: dna = 'TTACGGAGATTTCGGTATGCAT'@def transition_into

The output will differ each time the program is run unless
`random.seed(i)` is called in the beginning of the program for some
integer `i`. This call makes the
sequence of random numbers the same every time the program is run and
is very useful for debugging. An example on the output may look like
!bc dat

% if not PRIMER_BOOK:
Note that the mutated DNA should contain more nucleotides of the
type where the total probability of transitioning into that particular
nucleotide is largest. The total probability of transitioning into
a particular base can be computed by a bit a probability algebra.
Let $X$ be the initial base at some position in the DNA and let $Y$
be the new base after mutation at this position. The probability
that $P(Y=b)$, where $b$ is some base (A, C, G, or T), is built up
of four mutually exclusive events:
!bt
\[ P(Y=b) = P(X=A \cup Y=b) + P(X=C \cup Y=b) +
P(X=G \cup Y=b) + P(X=T \cup Y=b)\]
!et
A joint event can be expressed by the (conditional) transition
probabilities, e.g.,
!bt
\[ P(X=A \cup Y=b) = P(Y=b | X=A) P(X=A) \]
!et
leading to
!bt
\[ P(Y=b) = \sum_{i\in\{A,C,G,T\}} P(Y=b|X=i)P(X=i)\]
!et
The probabilities $P(Y=b|X=i)$ correspond to a column in the
transition probability matrix. If each of the initial events
$P(X=i)$ are equally probable, $P(X=i)=1/4$, and $P(Y=b)$
is then the sum of the probabilities in the column corresponding to
$b$, divided by 4. We can now compute $P(Y=b)$ for
$b$ as A, C, G, and T:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/mutate.py fromto: def transition_into_bases@# Test large data

The $P(X=b)$ probabilities corresponding to the example run above reads
!bc dat
{'A': 0.26, 'C': 0.25, 'T': 0.30, 'G': 0.19}
!ec
Transition into T ($P(Y=T)$) has greatest probability (0.3) and this is also
confirmed by the greatest frequency (0.41).

======= Classes for DNA Analysis =======
label{bioinf:oo}

We shall here exemplify the use of classes for performing
DNA analysis as explained ${primer_book_comment("""in Sections ref{bioinf:count}, ref{bioinf:freqm}, ref{bioinf:freq:analysis}, ref{bioinf:basefreq}, ref{bioinf:gene2protein}, ref{bioinf:lactase:milk}, and ref{bioinf:random}.""")} ${not_primer_book_comment("""in the previous text.""")}
Basically, we create a class `Gene` to represent a DNA sequence (string)
and a class `Region` to represent a subsequence (substring), typically an
exon or intron.

===== Class Region =====

The class for representing a region of a DNA string is quite simple:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dna_classes.py fromto: class Region@class Gene
Besides storing the substring and giving access to it through `get_region`,
we have also included the possibility to

  * say `len(r)` if `r` is a `Region` instance
  * check if two `Region` instances are equal
  * write `r1 + r2` for two instances `r1` and `r2` of type `Region`
  * perform `r1 += r2`

The latter two operations are convenient for making one large string out
of all exon or intron regions.

===== Class Gene =====

The class for gene will be longer and more complex than class
`Region`. We already have a bunch of functions performing various
types of analysis. The idea of the `Gene` class is that these
functions are methods in the class operating on the DNA string and the
exon regions stored in the class.  Rather than recoding all the
functions as methods in the class we shall just let the class "wrap"
the functions. That is, the class methods calls up the functions we
already have.  This approach has two advantages: users can either
choose the function-based or the class-based interface, and the
programmer can reuse all the ready-made functions when implementing
the class.

The selection of functions include

 * `generate_string` for generating a random string from some alphabet
 * `download` and `read_dnafile`
   (version `read_dnafile_v1`)
   for downloading data from the Internet and reading from file
 * `read_exon_regions` (version `read_exon_regions_v2`)
   for reading exon regions from file
 * `tofile_with_line_sep` (version `tofile_with_line_sep_v2`)
   for writing DNA strings to file
 * `read_genetic_code` (version `read_genetic_code_v2`) for loading
   mappings from genetic codes to different type of names for amino acids
 * `get_base_frequencies` (version `get_base_frequencies_v2`)
   for finding frequencies of each base
 * `format_frequencies` for formatting base frequencies with two decimals
 * `create_mRNA` for computing an mRNA string from DNA and exon regions
 * `mutate` for mutating a base at a random position
 * `create_markov_chain`, `transition`, and `mutate_via_markov_chain`
   for mutating a base at a random position according to randomly
   generated transition probabilities
 * `create_protein_fixed` for proper creation of a protein sequence (string)

The set of plain functions for DNA analysis is found
in the file ${link('dna_functions.py')}, while
${link('dna_classes.py')} contains the implementations
of classes `Gene` and `Region`.

=== Basic Features of class Gene ===

Class `Gene` is supposed to hold the DNA sequence and
the associated exon regions. A simple constructor and a few
methods may take the following form:
!bc pycod
from dna_functions import *

class Gene:
    def __init__(self, dna, exon_regions):
        self._dna = dna

        self._exon_regions = exon_regions
        self._exons = []
        for start, end in exon_regions:
            self._exons.append(Region(dna, start, end))

        # Compute the introns (regions between the exons)
        self._introns = []
        prev_end = 0
        for start, end in exon_regions:
            self._introns.append(Region(dna, prev_end, start))
            prev_end = end
        self._introns.append(Region(dna, end, len(dna)))

    def write(self, filename, chars_per_line=70):
        """Write DNA sequence to file with name filename."""
        tofile_with_line_sep(self._dna, filename, chars_per_line)

    def count(self, base):
        """Return no of occurences of base in DNA."""
        return self._dna.count(base)

    def get_base_frequencies(self):
        """Return dict of base frequencies in DNA."""
        return get_base_frequencies(self._dna)

    def format_base_frequencies(self):
        """Return base frequencies formatted with two decimals."""
        return format_base_frequencies(
            self.get_base_frequencies(self._dna))
!ec
Observe how the methods just call up existing functions in
`dna_functions.py`.

=== Flexible Constructor ===

The constructor can be made more flexible. First, the exon regions
may not be known so we should allow `None` as value and in fact
use that as default value. Second, exon regions at the start and/or
end of the DNA string will lead to empty intron `Region` objects so a proper
test on nonzero length of the introns must be inserted.
Third, the data for the DNA string and
the exon regions can either be passed or downloaded and read.
That is,
!bc pycod
g1 = Gene(dna, exon_regions)  # user has read data from file
g2 = Gene((urlbase, dna_file), (urlbase, exon_file))  # download
!ec
If the files are already at the computer one can pass `None` for
`urlbase`. The flexible constructor has, not surprisingly, longer
code than the first version (but illustrates well how the
concept of overloaded constructors in other languages, like C++ and Java,
are dealt with in Python):

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dna_classes.py fromto: class Gene@def create_mRNA

Note that we perform quite detailed testing of the object type
of the data structures supplied as the `dna` and `exon_regions`
arguments. This can well be done to ensure safe use also when there is only
one allowed type per argument.

=== Other Methods ===

A `create_mRNA` method, returning the mRNA as a string, can be coded as

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dna_classes.py fromto: def create_mRNA@def write

Also here we rely on calling an already implemented function, but include
some testing whether asking for mRNA is appropriate.

Methods for creating a mutated gene are also included:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dna_classes.py fromto: def mutate_pos@def get_dna

Some "get" methods that give access to the fundamental attributes
of the class can be included:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dna_classes.py fromto: def get_dna@def __len
Alternatively, one could access the attributes directly: `gene._dna`,
`gene._exons`, etc. In that case we should remove the leading underscore as
this underscore signifies to the user of the class that these
attributes are considered "protected", i.e., not to be directly accessed
by the user. The "protection" in "get" functions is more mental
than actual since we anyway give the data structures in the hands of
the user.

## Note that copying from __len__ interferes with copying from
## the same method in class Region. Hence, we have copied the
## relevant code directly in here.

Special methods for the length of a gene, adding genes, checking if
two genes are identical, and printing of compact gene information
are relevant to add:
!bc pycod
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self._dna)

    def __add__(self, other):
        """Add Gene instances: self + other"""
        # We don't know what to do with exon regions
        if self._exons is None and other._exons is None:
            return self._dna + other._dna
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                'cannot do Gene + Gene with exon regions')

    def __iadd__(self, other):
        """Increment Gene instance: self += other"""
        # We don't know what to do with exon regions
        if self._exons is None and other._exons is None:
            self._dna += other._dna
            return self
        else:
            raise ValueError(
                'cannot do Gene += Gene with exon regions')

    def __eq__(self, other):
        """Check if two Gene instances are equal."""
        return self._dna == other._dna and \
               self._exons == other._exons

    def __str__(self):
        """Pretty print (condensed info)."""
        s = 'Gene: ' + self._dna[:6] + '...' + self._dna[-6:] + \
            ', length=%d' % len(self._dna)
        if self._exons is not None:
            s += ', %d exon regions' % len(self._exons)
        return s
!ec

===== Subclasses =====

There are two fundamental types of genes: the most common type which
codes for proteins (indirectly via mRNA) and the type which only codes
for RNA (without being further processed to proteins).
The product of a gene, mRNA or protein, depends on the type of gene we have.
It is then natural to create two subclasses for the two types of
gene and have a method `get_product` which returns the product
of that type of gene.

The `get_product` method can be declared in class `Gene`:
!bc pycod
    def get_product(self):
        raise NotImplementedError(
            'Subclass %s must implement get_product' % \
            self.__class__.__name__)
!ec
The exception here will be triggered by an instance (`self`)
of any subclass that just inherits `get_product` from class `Gene`
without implementing a subclass version of this method.

The two subclasses of `Gene` may take this simple form:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dna_classes.py fromto: class RNACoding@def _test\(

A demonstration of how to load the lactase gene and create the
lactase protein is done with

@@@CODE src-bioinf/dna_classes.py fromto: def _test\(@# Manual downloading and

Now, envision that the Lactase gene would instead have been an
RNA-coding gene. The only necessary changes would have been to exhange
`ProteinCodingGene` by `RNACodingGene` in the assignment to
`lactase_gene`, and one would get out a final RNA product instead of a
protein.

======= Exercises =======

===== Exercise: Find pairs of characters =====
label{bioinf:exer:pairs1}
file=count_pairs.py

Write a function `count_pairs(dna, pair)` that returns the number of
occurences of a pair of characters (`pair`) in a DNA string (`dna`).
For example, `count_pairs('ACTGCTATCCATT', 'AT')` should return 2.

# Note: dna.count(pair) works!

===== Exercise: Count substrings =====
label{bioinf:exer:substr1}
file=count_substr.py

This is an extension of Exercise ref{bioinf:exer:pairs1}:
count how many times a certain string appears in another string.
For example, `count_substr('ACGTTACGGAACG', 'ACG')` should return 2.

__Hint 1.__ For each match of the first character of the
substring in the main string, check if the next `n` characters
in the main string matches the substring, where `n` is the length
of the substring. Use slices like `s[3:9]` to pick out a substring of `s`.

===== Exercise: Allow different types for a function argument =====
label{bioinf:exer:freq:fargs}
file=find_consensus.py

Consider the family of `find_consensus_v*` functions from
Section ref{bioinf:freq:analysis}. The different versions work on
different representations of the frequency matrix. Make a unified
`find_consensus` function which accepts different data structures
for the `frequency_matrix`. Test on the type of data structure and
perform the necessary actions.


===== Exercise: Make a function more robust =====
label{bioinf:exer:get_base_counts2}
file=get_base_counts2.py

Consider the function `get_base_counts(dna)`
(from Section ref{bioinf:basefreq}),
which counts how many times `A`, `C`, `G`, and
`T` appears in the string `dna`:

@@@CODE src-bioinf/basefreq.py fromto: def get_base_counts@get_base_frequencies
Unfortunately, this function crashes if other symbols appear in `dna`.
Write an enhanced function `get_base_counts2` which solves this problem.

# Hints: defaultdict or test on if base in counts: ... else counts[base]=1

===== Exercise: Find proportion of bases inside/outside exons =====
label{bioinf:exer:Ainsouts:exons}
file=prop_A_exons.py

Consider the lactase gene as described in
Sections ref{bioinf:gene2protein} and {bioinf:lactase:milk}.
What is the proportion of base A inside and outside exons of
the lactase gene? Write a function `get_exons`, which returns
all the substrings of the exon regions concatenated,
and a function `get_introns`, which
returns all the substrings between the exon regions concatenated.
The function `get_base_frequencies` from Section ref{bioinf:basefreq}
can then be used to analyze the frequencies of bases A, C, G, and T
in the two strings.

The functions `transition` and `mutate_via_markov_chain` from Section
ref{bioinf:random} were made for being easy to read and understand.  Upon
closer inspection, we realize that the `transition` function
constructs the `interval_limits` every time a random transition is to
be computed, and we want to run a large number of transitions.  By (i)
merging the two functions, (ii) pre-computing interval limits for each
`from_base`, and (iii) adding a loop over `N` mutations, one can
reduce the computation of interval limits to a minimum. Perform such
an efficiency enhancement.  Measure the CPU time of this new function
versus the `mutate_via_markov_chain` function for 1 million mutations.
