the preprocess stage (# #ifdef ...) or in the mako stage
(if some_variable:).

PRIMER_BOOK: text to be included in the "Primer" book.
EBOOK: PDF version of the "Primer" book with hyperlinks (href command).

Life is definitely digital. The genetic code of all living organisms
are represented by a long sequence of simple molecules called
nucleotides, or bases, which makes up the Deoxyribonucleic acid,
better known as DNA. There are only four such nucleotides, and the
entire genetic code of a human can be seen as a simple, though 3
billion long, string of the letters A, C, G, and T.  Analyzing DNA
data to gain increased biological understanding is much about
searching in (long) strings for certain string patterns involving the
letters A, C, G, and T.  This is an integral part of *bioinformatics*,
a scientific discipline addressing the use of computers to search
for, explore, and use information about genes, nucleic acids, and
proteins.
